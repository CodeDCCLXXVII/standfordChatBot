Cameron.
Who?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
As in...
Perm?
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
How many people were in your old school?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
It's off. The whole thing.
And why would I do that?
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
We don't chat.
We're not.
Who?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I know, just let me sleep
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Who?
What are you doing here?
Yes
Something like that
Fallacy.
No what?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Why can't we agree on this?
Kat a fan, too?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What's to discuss?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
You're not helping.
But -- who -- what --?
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Excellency, you are right.
Your life, and that of others!
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
Thank God...
You don't usually ask.
There'll be a time.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
... for a commoner?
Chief says...
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You will regret this.
The land is there.  I know it!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Here.  I have your money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
No, he is here.  Shit...
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yes, but he was a cop.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
What are you asking me?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Daphne, I...
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
But Chief?  Over this??
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Yeah.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
You ready?
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Hmmmm.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What's your accomplishment.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Well, that's great.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Where is escort service?
Two weeks holiday.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Sit down!
Surprise!  Surprise!
A job?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
What are you doing here?
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
A cheap hotel.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Yeah?  What kind?
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Yeah?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
It's possible.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I guess it isn't.
I guess not.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Yeah, I've been busy.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Pros.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
You're gonna help us take him.
Bullshit.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Want to try it again?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Not likely, convict.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Why?
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
There's nothin' to talk about.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I don't know.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
That's the way I see it, too.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
You sure you want me to?
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Jack, wait...
Hiya, kid.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Let's go, Reggie.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
When?
Naw, right here's okay.
At your service.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
That's what I thought.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Hey bud! Finger here.
Uh... at least fifty.
Hi Ma...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Got it...
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
And the third one?
Cornelius..
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
I'm so tired...
I want to sleep... forever...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
You're welcome..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Do you know how much I missed you?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
Amy...
What are you talking about?
What can I do for you today?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'm camera shy.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Alright, Tom.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Any good?
Yeah, who's this?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Something like that.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
You enjoy it?
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
They're no friends of mine.
You'll get it when we get there.
Pardon me?
Max.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Good question.
Alright, I get the picture.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Who is he, his name?
I try to be.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Nothing remotely like this.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine...
That's exactly what I am.
Why do you think he did it?
Her belongings?
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Then we'll stay up together.
I'm sure they're around.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
That obvious, huh?
Three days.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Nice neighborhood.
About Freddy?
Your distraught.  It'll help...
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
Oh God!  He killed them!
You're not taking my baby!
Huh?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Been having bad dreams.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Alice...
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
He invited me to his house last night.
My father!  He's not - ?
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
So they caught up with you, too?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
'Us?'
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
What about down?
Under <u>water</u>?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
Huh?
Take a look.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
No. Black.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
How soon?
This spring.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
That was me.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Hmm.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
On your sleeve.
What?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I called Mommy.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
I'm fine, fine.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
The key, Wade.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Yeah, lots.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
I know who it is.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
I'm sorry about what I said.
What way?
Of course! I would've heard.
Wade.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Can --?
How's that?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
You and me.
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
The night before the shooting.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
That it wasn't an accident.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Stay cool.
I prefered the terrorists.
How many others killed?
why did they do that?
Well it worked.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
Come on, Alice.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
My husband is a very courageous man.
Yes
Say something dear.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
You'll do it?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
Hold on, Alice.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
Both of you.
We're under attack.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Yes I did...
Accelerators down.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
You mean...
Set!
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Certainly.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I will, but Jim won't.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Of course.
No. No thank you.
I like my horizons narrow.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And that fits?
Why'd I do what?
But I-- .
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
The human?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Did he find anything?
Talk to me, Hudson.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Hear me out...
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
Now, wait a second --
Thirty-eight...simulated.
I don't know.
Sir?
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
On my way.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
We ain't going anywhere.
Fuck you.
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Terrible.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
No, it's different, honey.
Yes.  A little girl.
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
His Grace is very angry with you.
Yes.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
The marriage!
What??
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Oh, damn!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
I was at hand.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Behold!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Enchanted, Madame.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
I will.
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
It couldn't be better.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
German!
Well, we can.
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
What man?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Of course.
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
With the tenors.
Show me.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Exactly.
But, Your Majesty -
Exactly. A dance.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I regret it is not too familiar.
No, you didn't!
But not his body.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
The zoo? Is he rational?
What?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
That's easy enough.
What?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Will you think about it?
Very nice.
No what?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Two weeks?
Yes.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
You ask them.
Apparently so.
What was it?
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Plan?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
No.
Yeah.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
David!
Will you be quiet?!
What do you think?
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Why don't we ask him?
Send them in.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Why not?
How much?
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Oh!
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
All right, Jack, all right.
Get out, get out!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
What is?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Why, Cyril, you're insane
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Hello, darling.
Well . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Tomorrow night?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Got my letter?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
Yes, sir.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Huh?
Was it twelve o'clock?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I don't know.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Two.
Exactly.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
It was exciting.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Sure, cousin.
Yep.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Well?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
It's a secret.
What is it?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
You're doing just fine.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
Heard of him.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Where will you find such a girl?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
"Hmm" what?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
I guess so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Not at all.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Move you fools!
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
We did.
Sir?
I remember you.
Oh, that's the best part.
Can't you tell me anything?
In English, Pinkerton.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
Stop it. I'm...
Nice?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
You just haven't been looking.
I don't think so.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
Good coloring.
The message you left.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Sorry. 
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Uh huh?
Paul Owen.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Oh no, I'm okay.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Shoot.
No problem. 
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
So was I.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Not really.
What?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
Isn't that -- extreme?
It was a hate crime.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You can't just walk in, either.
Nothing.
Nothing?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Prick.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
What?
What'd they ever do for you?
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
...Worse?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Wait... He knows.
I mean, it's your life.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
You're famous around here.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
What about "60 Minutes."
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Gary.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
I met this girl.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
You may.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Good luck, Austin.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
Be careful.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Be careful!
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Excuse me?
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Behave!
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Not me.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
What did you say?
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Really?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... love ...
Three days.
Impossible?
Ropes?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The Institute ... the funding ...
So am I.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
I'm already married ...
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Whereas you are.
Mother?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Do you really think so?
And I suppose you're the knight.
As per mother's instructions.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
You mean my other self ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
You're playing games.
I thought you didn't.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
I think so, thank you so much ...
Walk over to the window ...
You are, and it's behind you.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
The best.
I'm very happy for you two.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh... I got something for that.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Good...
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Great, Mom.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Any time, Al.
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you!
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
That's it.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I just want to be alone.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
My gift to you.
The best table in the house.
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
In the Field Museum once.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Thanks for calling.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
-- I work for the city.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
It's a small town.
The outlets.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
-- Another backdraft.
No it couldn't.
And the putty around the door?
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
I have a job.
Nice boat.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
It's in my blood, Willy.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I'm busy.
I'll be there.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
Okay.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
And the world -- the whole world.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
Don't you have any leads at all?
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
What money?
What case?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Ho!
What's your name?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
How much?
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
That can be done.
No costume.  No blackface.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I've never been given a fair shot.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
What are there character traits?
Who are the other characters?
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Nobody told me anything.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
I'm in till the end.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
The big one.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Hi, Mona.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
No, before my time.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
You can go now.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I have acted as I think fit.
Neither!
What is the service, sir?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Never.
Not even that.
Not one.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
The Prince left him only that choice.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Yes?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Can anybody hear me!
Shut up.  West's dead.
Of course --
There were six of us...
Epilepsy.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
You hated West more than any of us.
What don't you know?
Then who did?
No. Poetic justice, though.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
No. I said Dunbar.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
Maybe --
Well, he's a good soldier.
Who killed Pike?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Does Osborne agree?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Excuse me?
Good cop/bad cop?
You're off to a late start.
What point?
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
You couldn't have known --
Good, just making sure.
What if I don't want it?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Poor fucker my ass...
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
Sir, yes, sir!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
Yes!
I don't expect to.
Fine, I will.
I brought it.
Well, she... uh...
So I've heard.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Go.
I never knew.
You don't like it?
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
I'm not scared.
Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You mean, while I'm here.
Yes.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
How did you get so many?
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Because he's dying.
You're not.
I need you on my side.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
You can see why it's sensitive?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Tell me what he said.
Do you believe in love?
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
Yes.
What's wrong?
They go.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In every sense. If at all possible.
What?
Fine.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
Oh Jesus.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay we won't talk about it.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
When? Now? Oh. No.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Come on, gal...
What?
I said... STOP!
Uh-uh.
I don't fuckin' cook.
We drinkin' buddies now?
I tried.
Looks like you know a song.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Go ask him.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Rae don't do this now...
Rae!
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Why?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
I didn't know.
I hope not.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
You'll take care of that.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Let's go.  Him first.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
Why's that?
He's got a reason.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
The cheese...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Why would you care?
Might be different in New York.
Dope?
What...?  What if I say no?
Why me?
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Not to be trapped.
Would you like to be modified?
Also extraordinary things.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
No.
When?
Hello, glad to meet you.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Soon as I finish the job.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Number three.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I'm taking a piss.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What's suck night?
I work alone.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Please.
Yes.
Discreetly.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
I don't have one.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Just better.
Beautiful.
Is that why you're still here?
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Yes, ma'am.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I can't, it's yours.
Okay.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why not go to work for me?
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Night!
Okay.
Why?!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
Two weeks.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Um-hum.
I certainly do!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Really?  Okay!
Neat. Goodnight!
What?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Why?
Then why go there?
No kidding!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
I'll try.
I love Lucy!
When did we get it from them?
So, did you buy a movie?
And thanks for always being happy!
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
The sky!!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
All back East.
Really?
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Then after that it's safe.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Yes.  Well... yes.
What?
Coming!
Sure.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes.
Excuse me.
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
No.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Then what?
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
No way.
Lie down on the bed.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Falling.
Don? Are you in with them?
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
That's good.
Frank would open you.
Kiss me.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
I want you to stay with me.
Bull.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Yes, but.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Yes.
Mom.
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Uh-uh.
That's too bad.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright.
Let's go.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
This is not my usual Friday night!
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Okay, Sandy.
Jeffrey? Why?
You like mysteries that much?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
No Jeffrey!!
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
I-I'll tip her.
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
We're here brother.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Can she I.D. them?
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
Rocco!
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Twist of lemon!
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
I'll be back at 9:00.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
This is some crazy shit, man!
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, what'ya do?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Open it!
God have mercy on my soul.
Just go!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
What does Starsky say?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That sets it off.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
This was in fourth grade.
This morning.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
That's what she is!
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Yeah. It's pretty good.
What?
There's not enough time.
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
The grandfather clock?
Nothing.
Dignan, I --
Thanks.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
Yes, he did.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Nobody does.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Temporarily.
Feel this.
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Not even for emergencies?
No.
So who's going to know?
That never would of --
Yes. I did.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
This is natural.
Don't count it.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I told you they were there.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
This could be a trap.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
He's stuck between two floors.
Run. Run. Let's go.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
I'm working on it.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
This is no good.
We're just going over a few things.
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
He left his sweater.
Where?
No. I just have short hair.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Bourne comes here? Why?
Never heard of it.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
What do you have, Danny?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
I don't want you to forgive me.
You're a liar.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
He's dead.
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
I'll get the book.
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
Where are you going?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Yes.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
So when was I here?
What's that?
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Believed what?
Some women like Dobermans --
Alright...
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
It's up to us, Hamish!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
That depends on the man.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
I... accept your proposal!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
Tonight then.
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I... I don't remember.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
So you believe me?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Why's that?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Who -- who are you?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Gee, thanks friend.
What?
What happened?? Where are we?!
Huh?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Goodnight.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
It's not for sale at any price.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Practically no one.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
We said "no questions."
Yes?
Uh huh.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Richard, I had to see you.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Oh, Rick!
Because you're getting on that plane.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Goodnight.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I said, ask your wife.
Thank you.
No. It's all arranged.
Here it is.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
May we proceed with the business?
-- Thank you.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Good day.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Huh!
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Hello Ugarte.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Then don't have a drink.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Fix raft first.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You are.
There was an unavoidable delay.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
So do I.
He's your cute thing.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
There isn't any us.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
But I might not have.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Two.
Burma!
Okay...
But you had so much *responsibility*.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
It will be okay.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You don't understand! It's her father...
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Hi...
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But did you know him?
His father's dead, right?
It's okay--I don't mind.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
I guess so...
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
It looks like scurvy.
I don't think so.
You do it then.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
Right.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
It look nicer then home!
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
She took off in the night!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
And you have this letter of intent?
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Come on...
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
We'll use the Euc.
I have a good crew.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
Stake you?
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Very much so.
I don't trust anyone.
Lighten up.
Did I miss something?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Do you have something to prove?
WHAT?
Sounds respectable.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
What about the money?
No, I want my cut!
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
We never had a problem with that before.
Do you have a ticket?
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I'm sorry.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Stand up.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
What are you talking about?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I want to hear it.
I start Monday week.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
I hope it brings you luck.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
What?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
You know where I'm from?
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
The debts.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Absolutely not.
You don't like cheats, do you.
What kind of trouble?
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Let it go.
I told you, all bets are off.
I have to take the car.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Turn left at the lights.
She's my baby.
You've done pretty well.
Some other time.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'll tell you later.
They've been tested.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Yes.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
Eventual supernova.
I think he's talking to it.
Where's the fail-safe key?
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Armed.
No.
And I saw that I was alone.
That is correct.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
...nine seconds...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes, Doolittle.
Any planets?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Oh, sure.
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Yeah?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Ah... pity, pity...
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
What?
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Later.
Whoever that is.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Something.
How well do you remember the lab?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
You believe that?
And you still think you can do something to change that.
But she does work here?
Any idea when she'll be back?
Look, I don't know what you want--
I think you should go now.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
I'm on my way.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
A little what?
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Pull the cash.
She's got my word.
What if he's on the level?
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
We gotta talk.
You don't.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
More than anything in the world.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What's it worth to you?
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
The paint!
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Check.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Yeah.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
I don't even think you have a gun!
Neither do I!
Yeah, you did!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Beg pardon?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
What did you say?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Infant Memory Generators.
What do you mean?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Where are you going?
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I think he saved my life.
Can anyone else see him?
Is Callie still around?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Because I'm so horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What's her name?
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
He was a year ahead of us?
I guess they made him do it.
Beg pardon?
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
C'mere. I love you so much.
I just did.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Yes, Leslie!
Then it must be Wednesday.
Loretta, shut it.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Okay. Take her purse.
What?
All right, let's go.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Harold!
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
The President of the United States.
"My dear"...
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
I don't wanna work at all.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
That's not bad for any day.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
This is terrible!
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
I found it.
Like this. 
Yes sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Three quarters of an hour.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
You've never been?
Oh no?
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Is he... dying then?
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...I learned a long time ago.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Merrick".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Yes.
Not at all, John.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Fine.
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Yes. John wants it.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
I see the world.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Well... isn't it great?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
But you don't want to hear it.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
What about the raping?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
What?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
But...
Very deep... usually...
I know. I know.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
DEATH!
He hasn't.
Well, where is he then?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
What are you talking about?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
What have you got there?
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
She knows it was our fault!
You fool!
I hate you! I hate you!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Sweetie, we called the company.
Yeah.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Here we are.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Okay.
That's okay.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Cheers.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Thanks.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
That's scary sounding.
Yeah? Oh, great!
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Yes.
Yeah.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Let's talk about it later.
You're not ready.
No, it isn't that.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Do you remember what we talked about?
Not yet. Not married.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
yeah?
Okay.
I love her.
Yeah, maybe.
Female.
It's freezing out here.
I love you.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Your dried cum.
Long day thinking.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
And what are you like? A wino?
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Oh! Great. That's great!
'Night.
Nah, I don't know.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
What?
How did I look?
Hi.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
Welcome, Howard.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Yeah.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
The Clock People?
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I don't.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
What is Debbie's position?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
Yep.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
The containment, Second Containment...
Will it work?
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Some things you don't get over.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Starck!
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Peters...
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
That is not acceptable --
What about it?
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Where is it?
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Radiation interference?
What's going on in there, Starck?
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
I did.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
It means nothing.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
I'm sure he's matured since then.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Ben. Are you okay?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Last one down springs for room service.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Ben! Ben!
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Blockhead started it!
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
I was talking about us. Working together.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Sure.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
You can't leave them out there.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Don't worry about it.
Later.
Sis.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Dad says!
Sure. Come on in.
Hello.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Did you go home and get it?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm really pretty busy...
Okay. See ya.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
That's me, Merv.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Just be glad you're all right.
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What class?
You keep them.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Oh. I see.
Righto!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Naw!
A major!
Las Vegas.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
Plans?
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Us?
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
With what just happened upstairs --
And the rest of 'em?
Shit!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
He's dead.
Anyone else?
Oh.
But --
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
He's dead.
Huh?
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What do you mean what?
Two.
Covered.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What?
You keep that key handy.
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
GO-GO-GO!!
I'm fine, I really am.
Right.
I'm not lying.
I said I'm not lying.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Right now we have to be practical.
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
But I'll never win that.
See you next weekend, Dad.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Why?
What about your husband?
Why, you... you little bastard!
Don't touch me.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Well? What'd you think?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
Kaminski.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Yeah.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
I know.
Calm down, Frances.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
I love you too, Frances.
Yeah. I don't know.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Run!
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
Yes, Mama.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Huh?
The music? Or the fire?
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
I am afraid.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
All my life I've known.
Not as weak as I.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Oh God.
They'll hang him all the same.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
You can't. Death is God's will!
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
You've been going round-the-clock?
For what?
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Let it go.
Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?
Who are you?
No, no, they're all dead...
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You're right. It makes no sense.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Okay.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Where's Ned?
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
So do I just follow you?
On the dresser.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Scott and Kate.
Auto wreck.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes.
Real McCoy.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Not good enough, swear to God.
Sure.
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Okay.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
You can't come in here.
Shut up and start the car.
No.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
-- This conversation is over.
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
No, I didn't.
I did?
What?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Yeah.
No problem, lieutenant.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
West?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sir?
Get it up!
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I'd sure like to know who.
Yeah.  Me too.
They had to kill 'em?
I don't know...
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
Should I be afraid?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Show us where you are, Chief.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
Where's Audrey?
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Our network covers the Ranger games.
You'd be surprised.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What's it to you?
Five bucks.
This is not the place...
Allez, allez!
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
That is our job.
Get your people out of there or I will.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
You don't have the authority to do that.
We know.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Sure.
Good idea.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Where's my bed?
Thanks.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
Down there.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
Okay, now. But-
Wait two seconds then go.
Shit! Go!
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Something BAD happened here.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Right.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
Wait... Jason, Here!...
Mark 12.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
The army can survive without me.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
While they're strung out?
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
I'm not sure.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
You invented this, this...
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
George!  So good to be back!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
These supplies...?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
I rode here, on my horse.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
What else?  From Virginia?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We're leaving them?
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
George, I'm sorry.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Africa, of course.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. What's this?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
Not too bad.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
You positive about that?
You serious?
The airport.
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
Who is this?
Ray. Look at me.
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
That's what I'm doing.
Fuckin' basketball game.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
For a movie?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
One we're producing.
I believe it.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
Sit down, Leo.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Right. See how your story ends.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
What happened?
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Hm?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Mob guy?
Thanks.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
With that coxswain dickhead.
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Why not.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Yeah, yeah.
How much longer's that gonna take?
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
Not in the eyes of the law.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Murphy.
I think you better see this for yourself.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
You smashed it!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Too big. More like a freighter.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Doesn't matter.
Couldn't sleep.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Yeah.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
I guess.
What?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
You can count on me, sir!
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
What do you mean "why"?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, well --
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Hey Josh.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What? Why?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
You loser!
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I can't believe it!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Totally! Look!
We should follow him home.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
What, is she black now?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Let's go hassle Josh.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
It'll only take a second.
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
I know a party we could go to...
What? Where?!
I don't believe you.
Wait...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Yeah, I guess... call me...
No, really...
Don't you want nice stuff?
I don't believe you.
Why? What did he say?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
Tell me what?
I did too!
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
NO!!!
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What are you, a fry cook or something?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Are you okay?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What? You're kidding me...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Sounds good...
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
What's up?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Yeah, well... me neither...
No problem.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Don't they, though?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
And it worked?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
Have you got that in writing? 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
Why?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Not even close.  What happened?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible. 
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Occasionally
Does he ever mention me?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
We definitely had a moment or two.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Same difference.
Hi, Egon.
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Okay.
I know.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I knew that.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
I'm Peter --
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
She's new in town.
I'm ready.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
Huh?  What?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
So what do you think it was?
What?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Are you all right?
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.
Goodbye.
Take me now.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
What is it?
What calls?
Has this ever happened before?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Yes.  I don't like this.
What on earth gave you that idea?
What?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
She said he was "the Destructor."
That appears to be the case.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
For what purpose?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
I am their hero!
You flatter me, Caesar.
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
I'm serious.
Take grain away from the army?
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
But have never been?
My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books.  But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Only from a distance.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Greeks?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Was I?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Did they ever find out?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Ah. Where?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
But you're not enrolled.
-- really incredible --
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
What did she say?
I don't feel well.
My belt.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
I might.
I'll think about it.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Oh no. He said that.
Ben.
Oh -- no sir.
You heard me. Out of here.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I'm in the bathroom.
The Singleman party, sir?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
No.
What?
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's all right.
No.
Won't you unzip my dress?
Then why do you keep running away?
What if he did?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Do you understand what I said?
Waiter!
Do you want to?
Do you want me to get it?
Yes.
The number.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Okay.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
How about art.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Yes I do.
What?
I don't remember.
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Thank you.
About five years.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Was he a law student at the time?
Yes.
Kind of.
That's enough.
Good.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Yes.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I do.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
You got me.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Swell. I appreciate it.
What?
I've got to go.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I will.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
You miss the point.
Mrs. Robinson?
Benjamin Braddock.
Yes, I can.
That what he says. Right?
Yes.
The pearls are in her room.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
I could take care of her.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
No -- why? -- should I?
Money.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
And then --?
Yes -- tired...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And what do you do -- now?
That's a silly joke.
I'll not denounce you.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
A little strange, Baron.
Good!
All right then.
I thought she was splendid!
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Be quiet.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Good heavens. What for?
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
But Doctor --
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
No - absinthe.
I'm the stenographer.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Tired?
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Here, hold up!
Oh, no.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
You've decided against the merger?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Goodnight, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Such nonsense.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
Again?
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
We must call the police, your excellency.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
What's bluff?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
Your what?
You expect me to buy this?
No.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
Roy? He's always crying.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
Perk.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Get off the grift, Roy.
I pay my debts.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
You must have some money.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I know you do, so that's why --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I'll get it.
Uh-huh.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
What?
NO!
Mm?
Because it's comfortable.
Nobody does that single-o.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
I saw her.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where?
Charming.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I thought you'd never ask.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Yes.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Why not?
Okay... thank you.
Bye Will.
What?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Very insightful.
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
What makes you think he'll come here again?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Halloween.
He's gone.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
It's a sign.  He's come home.
It was you.
Why did you take Jamie?
Samhain.
I dunno, boy.
Didn't recognize you.
We'll see.
At least we found the diamonds.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
First Nagasaki--now this.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You told me.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Me?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
What?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!  Out!
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I'll see.
Excellent!
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Go on.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Penelope!
Mom?
What's this?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I'm engaged.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Shouldn't you lie down?
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
If he thinks he's man enough.
Hello, Mother.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I've literally got to run!
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Yes.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
Now who's being cruel?
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
With spittle?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Don't shoot.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
How horrible.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Premature ejaculation.
What a relief!
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
What's his name?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
You're going out?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Doing what?
I'm glad.
Is he all right?
The park!
A what?
How nice.
You're saying no.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
We made the date three months ago.
They didn't murder me.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
Goodbye.
Is that a fact?
Penelope!  We're late!
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
No.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Well, I want to...
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
Okay.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
What girls you got here?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Yeah.
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You making a feature?
You don't drink?
Ulcers.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
She's dead.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
What do you care about?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
...What do you have to offer?
In G.R.? Why?
No.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
They're legal now.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Get out.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What?
I don't know.
Take it or leave it.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Ratan!
What?
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
It's a short film.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
Sounds all right.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Is this your shovel?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Promise?
She seemed yare to me.
That's really great.
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Because they are all the same.
Well...
Exactly.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Yes.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
With God?
With Life.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
"And this too shall pass away."
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Mother.
Harold!
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
We have no more surprises.
Oh, I do. I do.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Because I'm going to get my father!
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Then why are you here?
The Cenobites.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
I'm lucky that way.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Reliquary --
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His what??!!
Noooo! Noooo!!!
I knew those men better than you did --
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Yup.
Oh-n-no -- I --
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Good night.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
How big can it be?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
Goodnight.
Want to buy a bed?
Her mother's dead.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
It's important.
You remember.
Back from where?
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Sure.
No. I'm not.
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
That's more like it.
I prefer the floor.
I'll get the doctor.
I won't be a moment.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Where are you?
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
You like?
Kitchen's through on your left.
I don't believe it.
I want to see.
So lie down.
I thought we'd lost you.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Sure. Why not?
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Not the point.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Laura.  Her dad died.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Not really.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
I have a television.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
A couple blocks!  About six!
So.  Is now a good time?
Your desert island top-five.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Nice friend.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Good weekend?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
I'll tape it for you.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Think about it, Rob.
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
I think you know that.
I don't know.
I suppose so.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Fine.  One.
You won't like it.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Have you slept with him yet?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Those aren't mine.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
What?
What about Ian?
Okay.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I know.  I don't get it.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I don't know.
Well, you've asked.
How're you holding up?
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Whiskey.
That way.  You?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
No, we...
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Yeah.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
You're very macabre.
Why?
No.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
Probably.
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
You had to do _nothing_!
Maybe.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
Yes.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
I'd like you to try.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Will I see you again?
You have lived forever.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Why?
What are you doing man?
Aye.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
How can I stop such a man?
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
And you?
I'll be back when I can.
I have no future husband.
Kiss me.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Not likely.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Don't threaten me, Private.
I don't know.
How many came?
And the Bulgarian?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
You're wrong.
MACLEOD!
It's all we have.
Are you here?
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
No.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
But --
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
The money? Why?
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
The power of the press, huh!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure you can. Come on.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You bet I've got a better offer.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
No kidding?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
What tricks would I pull?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
I know. Where is he, I said.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Where's some paper?
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
I'm finished.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
What's the matter with my brains?
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
You got plenty of money?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Call you back.
What?
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
I won't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
I'm telling you!
I'll go right after it.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
And up a dime.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl. 
Sure I do, Earl.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Ssh!
How much do you make a week?
Who do you think!
You mean here in the city?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
Come on, fellas.
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
Very well, Grandpa.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Apparently so.
Say them.
You wouldn't.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
They've got the real thing outside.
That's not the point.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Oh, that.
Jam.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam.  They could poison half the country.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Grace!
Play something, Grace.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
How long?
Am I? Maybe I am.
No, I told you...
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Tickets for what?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Yeah?
When you were outside with Bill.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
You got to be fucking joking.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Recover any bodies?
Yep, I found something.
I don't doubt that.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
You said it, not me.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Call Wydell.
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
I always favored the Hulk.
What.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
No "buts." Go to your room now.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Like father, like son.
French?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Not at all.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Stop. Get away.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Hi. It's Nathan.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
That's not how he tells it.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Please let me go with you.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Ouch. Yeah?
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Yeah?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Oh, Rosie.
You've got to respect that.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
That's a great idea.
Oh, and the sun block?
Absolutely.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
Such as what womanly things?
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Even better.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
No.
Right.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Well, nobody has to sell.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Do you really think you can beat him?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
What is?
A thousand.
To do what?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Where do I sign?
I been thinking.
What's that supposed to mean?
Where?
How're the hands?
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
Fifty per cent?
Who's he?
You well-heeled, partner?
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Oh yeah? Where?
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Half and a dollar.
What?
How long have you been waiting?
Fair.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Can I buy you another drink?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I used to be an actress.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
No. I'll take you home.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Give it back to me.
You wanna drink?
No. You?
Is that what makes a winner?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
First time for everything.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
I'll be up later.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
We move.  Place to place.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You know what I mean.
What's inside?
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Virginia...?
You built things.
That's the Air Force Base.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
What did it look like?
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
Is that all he said?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
No, but it was here.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
It's really nice of you to help us.
You have to leave the White House.
He's not going to listen to me.
David, don't...
Did it work?
Love was never our problem.
That's the good news?
Just do it!
Can't this thing go any faster?
You try Martin?
You can do that?
He wasn't the President then.
I'm making a mess.
What'd I say?
We'll meet you there.
She should be shortly.
ETA with target; four minutes.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
What?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Butt-munch.
We're already over Mach 2!
It's all fuzzy.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Yes?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
I'll never forgive myself --
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Head for the fireplace!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
What?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Marcus would agree with me.
I know, Dad!
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
I don't need camels.
Who are you?
You think so?
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Finally!
You should have been there...
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Lao She.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
You don't like him do you?
Why they glow like that?
You're betrayed Shiva. 
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
Dr. Jones?
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
There's got to be another way out.
Figures...
Why not.
...I need to make a phone call.
Who am I?
I told you, my name is Al.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
I'll talk to them.
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
Too late...They want you.
I'll sue.
We have to get out of here.
With Authority!
What does it say.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
The man.
Don't know.
Just scratched my arm, why?
Good. Get to a phone.
What am I supposed to do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
I can't do that.
Are you screwing with any nerves?
A girl.
Which language?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
What?
To the hotel. To register.
Rene...
What are you looking at?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Osaka.
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
I told you, I have a feeling...
You were with GRUNER!
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
I can't handle that thing.
And don't let her know, either.
I don't know.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Oh no!
I'll get us out of here.
That's nice.
Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Let us get to the border!
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Oh.
How do I look?
Thanks.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Who?
Not...complaining, actually.
Sir?
Yessir...very good sir.
Yes?
Do what?
I just work for the travel firm.
It's not apparent.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
That depends...
You seemed interesting.
You did.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
We figure out if it's in here.
Oh.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
That I really don't know.
Can't you do something?
Why did you, then?
We're not moving fast enough for him.
...Piece of mind.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
The experiment. The danger...
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Whoever took it does.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
Instant rice...?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Mom.
You got a deal. 
Monday.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
How about you?
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
I'm afraid you are.
Before you go...
What caliber is your gun?
Catch ya' later.
Well, at the end of the day... because of your segment... the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company... could own CBS.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
How are you, Jim?
You ready...?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Right now?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I'm doing an interview.
I have to take a shower.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Alright?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
You eating with us?
No shit.
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
I disappeared on you?
What I've seen... I've liked.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Fuck you, too!
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
...okay.
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I heard.
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You greased the rails!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
Hello, can you hear me now?
You called me.
Liane has filed for divorce...
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
When should we do this?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Here. Got pictures.
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Mr. Dumbarton.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
We rest, Your Honor.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Is she Asian?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Yes?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
I'll be right back.
Isn't everything?
No. I haven't. Have you?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Marylin! Listen to me.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Your mother was.
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No.
Yes. Again.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Miles.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's marriage.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
Marylin.
You have some?
Sometimes I forget.
So. Now what?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
Ha Ha.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Now Rex.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Video.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Is she going through with it?
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yes, sir?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
And this is what you wantthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Are you going to see him?
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to  as long as I can get her back. 
Lower the boats!
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Yes, sir.
Any others?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn As life's corners I . . .
. . . turn."
Ohthe papers
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
You're on a budget from now on.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
The pleasure is all mine.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Oh, no!
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
You! Don't make me laugh.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Husband?
Yesif he is your husband.
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Get out!
Yes?
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
Eight o'clock.
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
ain't got a hat
What?
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
What's the idea?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
What's on your mind?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Right.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
So you saw Oswald how many times?
There were no phone records.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Why?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
There were admirals.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta get him in, boss.  I need more men - I can't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie... This is our case!
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
Allen Dulles?
They're gonna love you, chief.
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Some people would say you're paranoid.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
She's the best damn witness we have!
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Yes.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
But then you told her you were home.
I understand.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey, Jackie.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Arrest me.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Can I see your I.D.?
In cash.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
He called you?
He came by.
We talked.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Uh-huh.
Less ten percent.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I never lied to you.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Yeah?
You know what we want.
He sells guns.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
Uh-huh.
But you didn't do that.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
Not in the fitting room.
Keep it between us girls?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I told them.
They already know it's you.
I don't know. One of your friends.
But you don't?
Can you cover that?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I can do that.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
I can sit through it once.
Really, I'm impressed.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan.  That's Japan.
Sure.
All right already.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
That was Beaumont.
But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going.
What's your relationship?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
You know how she is.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
That's right.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
I think I do. Is that good enough?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
House or apartment?
Did the police contact you?
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Git your ass in here.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
All I did was walk out with it.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
It's Beaumont.
'Ola!
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
I'm alive.
I see.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Short? It's ended.
Oh, terrific.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Maybe the demons are real.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Hey, wait!
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
She didn't. That's about all she said. Put your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let it out.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
I can't relax.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
What?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
I haven't seen her in months.
Ah!
I need your insight, your intuition.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
How's it going?
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
They weren't human!
Show me Della!
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
I love you, Jez.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
How?
Are you out of your mind?
It's so hard to believe.
It's not practical, Jez. It'll be hard enough alone.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
Jake, what is it?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Total delirium.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
What is wrong with you?
I'm awake?
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
I work in a bakery.
I don't know.
You in trouble?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
On top of him?
Yes it does.
What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
We made it?
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
Where is he?
Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
Not so bad.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
No shit. I got no problem with that.
I'm on my way.
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
That ought'a help the situation.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Keep trying!
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
But...I...400 years?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
You got it.
Who's driving the boat?
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
You going to be all right?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Swell.
Our friend, the shark.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Think the tide's with us?
You from around here?
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I've got all these signs here...
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
I think I can top that, Mister...
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
I know.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Is that normal?
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
We could get back together too.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
You do?
I heard that was you.
You found us in the Penny Saver?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Oh really?
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Juno MacGuff.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
You're pregnant?
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
You mean like couples?
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Or...
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
It was magnificent, man!
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
I'm pregnant.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
Share the love, Tits!
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
What do you make with that?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
And I disagree.
She answered our prayers.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah, sure.
Do what?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
What'll we do out there?
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Turkey mostly.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Well, let's put it this way.  I need me a new woman.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Up yours.
Siesta.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Could be.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
It is right.
Yep.
You down with the boost?
Yep.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
So.
Where you at?
You sure?
Yeah me too.
What?
What the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Right now?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
I wouldn't believe it?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I know.
I didn't bleed.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Whah is dissdee?
Making love is like.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
No.
Oh god. That's horrible.
When are you gonna be back?
Hello?
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
It's very monotonous.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
I wouldn't know.
What?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Very good.
I've figured out the message.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
You're losing me.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Okay.
Yeah.
What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
What about the way he arranged the body?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Didn't you tell me that Debi Rutlege had just moved into her place also?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
That's got to be it.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Is it serious?
You're always in the middle of a match.
Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Okay.  So, tell me about yourself.  Are you married?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
Why?
No.  You were talking about chess.
She died in a car accident.
And you?
What?  By attacking me?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
I thought you said the line was busy?
For emphasis?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
It could be anything.
No he didn't.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I don't have to go through with it either.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
<u>What</u>?
About what?
Colwyn.
That way. I can feel the cold.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You have not slept in two days.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
Yes.
I can. Because I choose it.
I forbid you!
We must enter the swamp.
What will happen?
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
I cannot betray my bride.
I know you.
I knew you would not be. That's why I chose you.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Naturally.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
A <u>boar</u>? Those incompetent louts couldn't catch a piglet, much less a boar.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I only want one.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
<u>Me</u>? Travel with <u>you</u>? I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision. And I do not travel with peasants and beggars. Goodbye!
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
That I am, my lady.
You were lucky. I lost thirty there.
I was beautiful then.
She bore you many children?
Why must you know?
You lie!
No.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
How can you say it?
What?
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
...Because I feel it.
Yes.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Yes.
Three times, then two times.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Messina.
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Salute.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
Here comes the resume.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
The new store?
I've changed my mind.
You've just decided, is that right?
Yes.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
Pacifica, California.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
I see.
Doubts?  About what?
About my love for her.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact...
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
By car right?
Mammoth.
Yes.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
Oh, a coastal city.  That's good.
Why know?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Where am I?
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
Hello.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
You were going to get my door.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Right... OK...
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Be careful.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
I don't understand any of that.
They wouldn't know.
Will you lighten up, please?
Yes.
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Please, Yuri.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Yuri... are you...
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Go to hell.
Who?
I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
I believe you! Don't worry.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Because they got wet.
Tell him, Paulette.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Is everything okay?
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
He chose them already?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I don't know.
Spill.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
What's the point?  Look at me.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
You know her?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
So?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
No way --
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
What happened?
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
I got bangs!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
Maybe she found him like that.
Of course.
East coast people are different.
Now I am.
Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.
Thank you.
Chuck.
It's not a Theta --
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Fire moat... why do that?
What do you want with me?
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Protection?
Like some vile toadstool.
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
I didn't know... I --
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
Gump, is it?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
There must be an answer somewhere.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
It would appear so.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Whatever for?
Blackheart?
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
The chill is worse this night.
Easily spoken...
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
I could have struck off his head just now!
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
But you did... you did!
A promise is a sacred oath.
I detest serpents.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'm not its master.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
He did run?
Its powers are strong.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Only what's right...
You're teasing still.
Biting you?
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
Not very precise directions.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
I pray God grants it me.
How so?
You... you... you mortal you!
And as barren of love as stone.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Be fair, Oona.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Jimmy Squarefoot no lost.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
You follow.
You've been inside?
In a dream.
With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Since seventh grade.
I'm living here while I build another house.
Nope.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
I can't even take a shower here.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
What?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
I'm not.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I'll ask.
I'll be around to check up on you.
Mom...please.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
I almost saw Catalina.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
I'm not doing it!
You'll have money when you work for it.
Did you got through my pants?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
Sit down for a second.
Try it.  It feels good.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I haven't been touched in years.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I want you to find someone for me.
It's okay.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
A blueprint spool.
Where have you been for a week?!
I drove over and you were gone.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
What?
Which?
I dreamed about your house last night.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I can hire workers to help me.
You bit my finger.
Peter left me yesterday.
So could I.
I could use the money.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We should take a vacation.
What?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go because of Sam?
Do you like red?
You got a dog?
I didn't go in your room.
Yes, it is.
That's my girl.
Not for me, it ain't.
Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
She's alright, isn't she?
She got married last month.
Married?
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Here!
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
Nothing.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Oooh...
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Here I am.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
He's dead.
It ain't here.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
Claude.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
I'm stuck!
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Let me see that.
Make 'em throw strikes.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
They're touching.
Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
You killed Santa Claus?
Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
He must still be in there.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
Satchmo.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
Blacks welcome there?
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
You mother...
Noon...
Sure, why not?
Try an angel.
Yeah, you do...
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Well, let's rock and roll.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
I think you're looking at him.
Now you're talking.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
So go get 'em, Dad!
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
What was it called, sir.
You're not saying it's up to me?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Peppermint... alright.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
So I followed him...
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Dude. Seriously?
You smell like coconuts.
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
The South.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
"Octopus people?"
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
I have to, Valerie.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
I feel sorry for you, boy!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
It'll be all right...
What other food?
Even the alarm didn't wake him.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Well... you can't have them all.
Why did you do that???!!!
No.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And?
I changed my mind.
And now?
How a Sandman lives.
A Runner gave it to me.
I let him go... believe me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
It's the only way.
For us.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Don't ever let go.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You're wrong!! It has to be!! It Just has to be!!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
Yes...
No.
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
What makes you think so?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Oh, yes... I think...
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
Pile in.
It kept going off for some reason. False alarms.
What is?
Yeah... Laurent.
His or ours?
You know what I think?
Yeah, I remember.
Can I call you?
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
Okay...
Are you positive he knows?
I don't know.
Pete... Don't...
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
In pornos?
Okay.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
What night is that?
What's up?
The wife killer?
You talk to him?
No... Here he comes.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
We'll get a tail put on him.
He won't give his name.
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
My... My head.
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
Wake me up when you get home.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Why would anyone do something like this?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
He's got some fucked up friends.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
You're my man, Pete.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
You know who it is.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Sorry... I...
I don't want to talk about it...
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
I'm a paleontologist.
Found in Asia!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
I'm never conversational before I coffee.
Is it?
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Yes.
Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
The police?
Just call me Barney.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
In a quandary.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
It's unbelievable.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Oh, immediately.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, dear.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
Sondra Bizet.
We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.  Look at the world today! Is there anything more pitiful?  What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality. The time must come, my friend, when this orgy will spend itself, when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword. Against that time is why I avoided death and am here, and why you were brought here. For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here. For here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule: Be Kind.  When that day comes, it is our hope that the brotherly love of Shangri-La will spread throughout the world.  Yes, my son, when the strong have devoured each other, the Christian ethic may at last be fulfilled, and the meek shall inherit the earth.
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
What are you talking about?
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
I don't see that there's anything to say.
You can't leave, George.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Oh, George . . .
You're wrong, George.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
In for what?
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Why?
It's Fenner.
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Yes.  Barney!
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
What happens if I say no?
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Actually, it didn't come from me.
Kay...
Sir, you can't just--
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Let's check am out.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
So... how did they get here?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
What the hell does that mean?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
I dunno. One?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
They're not my pals--
What if I don't?
The what?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Who?
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Wait.
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Who wanted her little girl back?
What --
I know... I do, too...
You set your patients on fire!
The nano... what?
-- go blind.  I know.
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Don't apologize, John.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
We won't let them.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
That was easy.
You're certain?
Really?  You've never been inside?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Sean, wait...
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
So you won't help me?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
I don't understand --
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I wanna kill my boss.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
It was nobody's fault.
Yes.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Good luck.
Is it the good room?
Manhattan.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
What time is it there?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I feel weird asking him.
Yeah? You sure?
Go.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
When's it going down?
Yeah.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
He must have that shit troughed.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
That's why they call it the smart money.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
You told him you liked him.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes. Goodbye.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
You don't know where you're going?
I'm on the phone.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
He's not here.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What are you saying?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Ask if he said anything to her.
Fuck them.
What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
Seat belt.
You sure?
Great. On my fucking room.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Fuck...
They asked who it was.
So they said more than the address.
I mean, that's what I heard --
You would think.
She was jonesing for me.
Where?
We're getting whacked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
C'mon, man...
We don't need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
No more, man.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Easy...
I'll be a minute.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
S'up.
Cool.
How much is what?
Drinks are free, right?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
You strapped?
It means you got a gun?
Watch it...
Pity. What's say we have a drink?
That shouldn't be a problem.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
You rode?
Don't worry. I get it.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
Let Billie finish.
That's a fact. What you do, boy?
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
What did you give it to me for then?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Okay, okay.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
Then the devil is white.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
Next week, Brother Minister.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
You have enough worries of your own.
Just an idle question.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
Talk about what?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Betty it's me. It's me.
Dear heart, where are you?
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
Is my family here yet?
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
That's right.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Just what are you saying?
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Entirely.
Say what you're saying.
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
I do know I love you.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
Please make way, please --
You're my father.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
That's right.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
[Si.]
[Daniel.]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Who are you?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[It's non-negotiable.]
[Her life for your life.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
I said the plan was right here.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
I'm a bargain.
Time will tell.
So you were unhappy?
Well, I let him go.
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
Don't worry. You will.
Are you afraid of me?
You think too much?
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
No.
Because...  I was already dead.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
What?
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
She wasn't so bad.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
I'm thirty-four.
Thank you.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
No...
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
How do you do?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You gotta good heart.
Put on your blue suit...
Marty...
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
What, Ma?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Right.
Hello, Thomas.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
How you, Radar?
Back home.
Or her figger.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
What do you think, Trapper?
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
I have a tent to myself.
Don't stop now! Please...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
What?
You betcher ass, General.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I found a doner.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
That's right. We work well together.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
I think we could still have a chance.
Same here.
Of course not.
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Second pint.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
What's wrong with him?
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
No, thank you.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
All set, Ann?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
The Websters!
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
A deal?
Oh.
Well, maybe you're right.
Has he been here?
Yeah, a little.
Where'd you play?
Where is she?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Who?
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Whyuh
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Uh-huh.
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
Shh!
What?
I didn't see anything.
No, sir.
He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Good. I don't want to be late.
You can't help me, man.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Automatic.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Roper...
How do you feel after a shooting.
Like it had to be done.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
I know.
Recruited you from where?
I'm not sure.
No.
It's against my nature.
To save lives.
Damnit!
Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
I worship you.
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I've proved that, didn't I?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
When?
...Let me just show you.
Do it!
Yeah.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
I can't do that.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
To live forever.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
This is how you pick up women --
No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
No...
Yes.
Yes.
One would assume so.
At least a day.
Go!
To hide the evidence.
-- The inside?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
But you were with me.
Activated.
Describe program function.
-- Standard.
Access established.
What?!
Ah... sure.
What does that mean?!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
But not you.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
What's that divided four ways?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
For being a man.
I needed to see you again.
It always is.
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Tommy Reina.
What's your problem?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Didn't know you felt that way.
And I got it all planned.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Not stupid. Fat.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I found that out.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Jesus.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything!
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Yeah...before your time.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Back? You're sending me back?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
...In some weird way I respect that.
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Monkeybone...!?
Sure. Why?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
He called me "Doc."
Can't you give it to me later?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'd better go report this...
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Mother!
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
What does he do?
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
... Manly?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
What for? Why, suppose there's a storm--all lines are down--how you gonna get a message to Ma?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
And to Don Quixote!
Yeah.
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Good idea. When?
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
What?
No--not offhand--
What!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
For a question!
I yield.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Nonsense, Jeff.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Will he yield for a question?
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Just fine.
Office of--Senator Smith?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
Right.
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
The Steering Committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
We're over in the House.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
Have I?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
I also answer to whistles.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No!
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
In Terry Canyon?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Are you drunk?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
What you *have* to do is fight!
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Oh--you are!
Goodnight, Senator--
Well! You don't say!
Swell!
Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
You're the best nurse I can think of--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Jim, I won't stand for it.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Just a minute, Joe!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Yes, indeedy.
He sure is.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Do you always wear your hair like that?
Uh-huh.
It's wonderful.
I say, to most people it's a washout.
You have?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
With pay!
Uh-huh.
Have lunch.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Hello . . .
Come on - let's go!
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Me sir?
I wanna see that guy!
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
No, thank you.
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Why should you?
Huh?
Only common sense.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Well, thanks, I - uh  How do you do? What is your name?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Uh-huh.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Christian Svenson.
Where is your farm?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
You're Walter, aren't you?
I just wanted to make sure.
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
How did they threaten you?
Good kids.
Uh-huh. What are they?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
No, not really.
I think he's got a point.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
Of course... I've heard great things about you.
Are we?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Stop now.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
It's a thought I had.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Tastes good.
I do.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Doc.  Ainge...
Where am I supposed to eat?
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Can you help Mom?
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
And he's where?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Yeah?
Of course.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
What is your name?
Will you wait for me?
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
What'd he say?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
It's just a thought.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
You don't think I'm insane?
But look at me now...
That'd be Lily.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Well, okay then.
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Do you know where I can steal some?
What does he want the book for?
That's one way of putting it.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
Exactly --
You will not believe it.
I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
Want to know?
I know my treasure.
They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Who was talking about what?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
I'm not?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
I'm staying.
FINE.
Got what?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
I was mistaken.
I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
Shut-up and get me off of here!
What's it look like!?
I only gamble with my life, never my money.
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Got it.
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
And some sandwiches --
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
What about Captain Amazing?
Too bad. PLUG HIM!
You underestimate yourself.
Roy.
Have you always lived here?
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And you are a fool.
When are you going to take off that mask?
My heart died a long time ago.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
Or flowers.
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
This looks like a job for Superman --
With or without him, we gotta go!
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Proceed.
Ah -- you approve?
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Where are they?
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
These are odds of 8 to 1.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
You realize what is at stake?
And where is the army?
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Yes, sir.
No, they're living in Nice now.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
It is the work of incendiaries.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Of course.
Promise me.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
You are my old friend.
But you will not... be safe...
I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I couldn't face telling you.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Do you know what you're saying?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
That is a matter of opinion.
Send him in.
And I can go free?
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Yup.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
What you mean, so?
Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.
Okay, plan B.
You go first.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
No, man, just wait.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I just wanted to give you this.
Better sooner than later.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
You damn right that's the big one.
I don't know.
What?!
Sorry, my ass.
I don't know the number.
Huh?
Shut yo' ass up.
For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
What?
Business.
I...
My security people are right next door.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
What about the gun?
You...
He's dead?
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
You know what I'm gonna do.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Over and out.
No...kisses to you.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Please...
What are you supposed to do?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Who?
So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Irene is going to help.
Fuckin' A.
Everybody does?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Where?
What gives?
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
How do you mean?
Say what, Walt Spoon!
A man of the Cloth?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
Blue men.
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Up river.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Huh?
No. No.
I'll tell.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Under the stone in the floor.
That's no secret. I'm five.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Can I have this?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahh!
The first night?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
It's about that John and that Pearl?
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What you been up to?
I been out with men.
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Not really.
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
Okay, okay.  I think.
What happens if they don't do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Like Rod Lane?
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
Mother, for petesakes.
Warm milk. Gross.
Nancy!
Dead and gone.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Of course. What's that?
Naturally, Comrade.
What are you serving?
I have nothing to hide.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
What is it, Anna?
Just for the honeymoon.
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
Right now it's on the balcony.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
No, no.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Good morning, Gaston.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Have you?
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
That's perfect!
It is Thursday!
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
Brave... that's right.
Yes, monsieur.
We did our best, Comrade.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
You want me to go in there?
What business?
Confess what?
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Me?
In other words you don't know.
No.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Please don't misunderstand me...
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
Ni-notchka.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Wounded? How?
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Oh, let it ring.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Because we are an odd couple.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Anything, Ninotchka.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
My darling.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
No. Nobody will find us.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
...but big.
Please.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now, Swana...
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
You haven't seen her yet?
Am I interrupting?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
All right, I'll listen.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Unfortunately.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
May I ask what has happened?
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
It's just a place for workmen.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
You did say it, sir.
Where the hell is he?
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
Is it?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
And?
I thought the gloves were off.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Fucking hell.
"Security" is not strong enough.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
All right.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ...
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
The White House.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Well, you sure been chock full of surprises so far, "Mister President."
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Free, if you're the president.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
That was a long time ago.
Mr. Nixon.
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
I like jazz ...
Oh yeah, he's good.
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Sir?
POWs.  And their families.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Is that the truth?
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Anything.
Yes!
Don't be ridiculous!
Who else'd be in your truck.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Didn't know there was any.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Nineteen zero and nine.
You're discouraged.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Well what would you call him.
He's real all right.
He won't neither. He never has.
No.
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Uh-huh.
I don't know. He ought to...
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Okay.
I put it in, Mama.
...I need to sit down.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Why would we go to Odessa?
What did you tell him?
What makes you say that?
I can hear it in your voice.
I can't say.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
You live in that house behind the store?
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.
Uh-huh.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
No sir, it's unusual.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
You want to change rooms?
No, one forty-two.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
How would you describe him?
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
Not any way.
Yeah. I was in Nam.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
I don't know. American citizens.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Tell him what you told me.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
No, I didn't have to.
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
Oh. How come?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I am?
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Are you and Larry happy?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Of course.
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Yes... maybe it was.
Ad lib?
I ran back in to get the phone.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I don't know.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
What's his real name?
He has no heartbeat!
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
What? Where was he?!
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
You still in love?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
More than you know. Is there anything else?
No, that should be more than --
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
He told us it's in the Buick.
What 'look'?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
...who doesn't?
"Injuns?"
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I don't know, George...
Better.
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
Her show?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
- and share one of your graves.
Do not seek the treasure!
Fire! I hate fire!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Suckin' away.
Devil his due.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
Not your...
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
You didn't know that at the time!
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
Blooey!
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.  C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Pardon?
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Yes, sir!!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Or we could do that yeah.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I'm starving.
I've never had a girl.
I don't want you to move.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Are those for me?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father?
I know that.
So?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Why?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
Yeah.
A little.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Peace out.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
NOT THAT ONE?!
I know.
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Hey.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Well, I know that now.
It doesn't work?!
Feel okay?
Yeah.
Nope.
Blue is phones?
He --
He WILL.
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
What if I do?
Okay.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Judge, calm down.
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
No Fuck you!!!
I don't know. Look around man.
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Alone...
Yeah.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Shut the fuck up!!
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Good.
Late summer.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
As do you.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
As you wish.
Oh?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
Oh?
Is that so?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Yes.
I don't care.  I hate him.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
But what about Thomas?
Yes, he does.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
Put them away.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Of course I will.
I will. Come and kiss me.
That's enough, Ellen.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
Then why do I have to go to bed?
I swear.
Not at all.
Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I don't know.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Ayuh.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Because it's right.
Wendigo?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
It's Ellie's cat.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Then why aren't you eating?
Would that I could.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I can't breathe.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
Yes -- yes.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
-- then we never would have met.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
That we are.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
Only a little.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Barbossa.
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
You haven't seen it.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Do you think she loves him?
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
That's the guy?
The replicators?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
That's what I thought.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
Three days ago it was.
That's right.
No, why?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Probably the caffeine.
On the counter.
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, and what might that be?
And you have him?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Don't worry, four eyes.
Dexter.
Certainly. Right over there.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
You wear them of course, silly.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
Are you crazy?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Your house?
That's ridiculous.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Sit down!
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Gloria Golden?
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Now Mr. Smith, now please
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Yes, of course. I'll get it for you
Yes.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Right!
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
What do you know about Conrad?
Right.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Here you are.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
I don't eat waffles.
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
I beg your pardon.
Hello, Joe.
Double strength!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
All right, Grandma
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yeah?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
What?
It can't be possible.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
No ...
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Where are you gonna go?
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
I don't believe it.
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
But it could happen.
Oh, no thanks ...
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
Real rain?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What?
I thought the books were blank?
Hello Mr. Simpson.
What color is that hedge of yours?
Just take deep breaths.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Can we do any better?
What were you doing in a library?
What do you mean?
It's okay.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Yeah ...
No. She really liked you.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
Yeah.
Sure ...
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
What the hell's going on!
My name's David.
What?
Excuse me?
BUD.
Look ...
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
I'm going to leave now.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Yes.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
... What's that?
Hi.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
So you're coming tonight, right?
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
It's not mine.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I....please don't do this.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Hi, is this Jack?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
You sound very cute, very nice.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yeah.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
No.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Yes I do.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
No, no. I did.
Are you learning how to play it?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Ok. Have a good trip.
Yeah.
I don't freak out very often.
It's Barry.
About six months ago. Why?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
What is this?
Let's go to the hospital.
You can't do that.
So here we go.
For what?
Did you do it?
No.
Why? ...what?
Sorry.
-- and this is confidential?
That's that.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Yeah.
Can you hang on a second?
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Let's just leave it there for now.
Where you goin?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What do you have in the house?
Well....what do you want, then?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Nothing.
You can't be late though.
Ok.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Yeah.
It's not bad, it's ok.
Ok.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
Then what's he doing here?
At your service, Count.
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
-- water! --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Of course.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Most assuredly.
What's that then?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
-- words alone are insufficient.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
You've come to lecture me?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
Very much.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Sure
Uh-huh
Randolph!
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
It's not really--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir? 
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
I am not doing Hearst.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Showing life
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
The old man has his own way of doing things
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Sorry to disappoint.
Don't do this
Listen to me-
Fuck you--
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
How?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
What?
But it's not a great syllable
Uh huh.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
Oh God.
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Very generous
Yes
Again
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
For Christ's sake, shut up--
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
I don't want to sit
Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
It was the best, kid
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
It's not done.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Nothing...
Hit me in the face.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Whadda you care?
Yeah, she's nice.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
Should I hit it?
No.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
I was just...
That he's got a pretty face.
I went to the movies.
With Salvy, eh?
You're a fuckin' liar.
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Who left -- where?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Give him evidence.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Like what?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
No.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
She pay you much?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
There's probably one in the basement.
Mrs. Doyle?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
So do I.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Now, Lisa --
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Still -- those witnesses.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
How?
A new disease.
Friend of yours?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Okay.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
No.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
You don't want me to go.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
What's that pounding?
Well maybe she better start.
No.  I don't think so--
I don't want to make friends.
You scared?
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
What's a chickie-run?
No.  It's okay.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
They're looking for you!--
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Not lately.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Why?
You sure?
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
Why?
Come on!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Leave me alone.
And your folks didn't understand?
If he could--
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Goodbye!  See you!
I'm not so bad.
Neither can I.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Are you?
What a relief!
What?
I never felt so clean before.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
We were romantic then too--
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Why?
Must have a way with stationery.
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel!
A man of some travels.
Don't hurt him...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He'll be dead when he does.
We sell children's toys --
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Nick...
JESUS CHRIST!
...maybe I die for Nick...
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
Get your own room.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
What?
He says he wants it now.
Well. I'm going home.
Who wouldn't.
I never worked at no casino.
Bam Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
Christmas... Eve...
I did.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
Get out.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
...never... tried...
NO!
I'm no threat without a gun.
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
He's not Nick Mason...
OPEN IT!!!
What?
Fuckin' freezing.
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And some pecan pie.
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Alamo...
And you set me up.
You gave them me.
I'm ninety-two years old --
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Me and Mr. White?
Yeah.
What about?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
It's a change.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
You gonna put it away?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Nope.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Lie back down, and try to -
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
I'm cool.
That's not correct.
A few cops.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
No shit?
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Of course.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
That fuckin did it!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
As far as -- Sonora?
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
You should know. She's in your dream.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
Hello, Miss Wells.
Nice.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
I won't again.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Nobody asked you to.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Then why stay in the hills.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
We don't want to go there.
What's the use.
I don't know -- I don't know.
I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I feel good anyways.
Oh, sure.
Steve --
That's it.
Would you die already?!
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Yeah, me too.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Shhh!
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Let's get a hot dog.
I don't care. You pick.
What, you think I did this to myself?
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
In about fifteen minutes.
Professor!
Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
Even in the bathroom?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Thanks, handyman.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
I guess so.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Ray!"
Mrs. Sutphin?
No more violence... No more violence...
I don't feel like rewinding it!
You scared me.
This is so silly. 
That's right.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
You bring me such peace...
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Bon Appetit!
How to send a bill!!
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Can we go there now?
Yes.
Drink.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
She can only use cash.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
What is it?
And that was all?
Why?
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
And then?
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I'm at sea, Jason.
But you're happy here -- you like your work -
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
Well, since, you're over twenty one
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Why not let your publisher judge that?
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Perhaps
I don't know.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
She's not been here for a long time.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
False alarm.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
What?
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
Are you in the middle of something?
Why not?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
I know.
How did you know?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
It won't. Are you ready?
Absolutely not.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
Why not?
So you have had sex.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
And now you can?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
That's very flattering.
Why not?
But I don't understand --
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
You did that?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
You bitch. I knew it.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What visitor?
Did you find him attractive?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Well, why?
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
It does not.
No.
Okay.
It was busy.
Nope.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
No.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Your first sexual experience.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
Is that what he tells you?
He doesn't have to tell me.
No? Not even one more?
No.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
I wish you hadn't done that.
No, John, things are getting real simple.
Plus first and last month deposit.
How about for five hundred?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
God, you need help.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Shut up!!!
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yes?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
He'll be really mad.
Sure.
You knew these people?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Uh, OK. Sure.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Gonna cut me open?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Who was she?
Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
So it seems.
Yes, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
I'd forgotten.
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
I'm sorry, Officer.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED SOME
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Fast!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
It'll just take a second.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Is it chicken?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Stephanie.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Good. How're you?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
That's your problem, Miles.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Now we're talking.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
You know that chick?
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Perfect.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
I want to go home now.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Bathroom.
Right now.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Nope.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
No.
What?
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
What?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
The plan is... you go.
I finished it.
The Windmill.
Oh yeah? How is it?
Hey.
What's the title?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Okay.
So what's happening with your book?
I told you I need a drink.
He had to make a phone call.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
It tastes old.
She doesn't answer me either.
You love walks.
Yes, it was.
I got him.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Graham.
Don't.
You're scaring your sister.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
There are none.
Sounds like a virus.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Pinned? What does that mean?
They think it might happen all at once.
What do you mean, the horses?
Sounds good.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'm sorry.
I just came out to say goodbye.
It's one thing to know it...
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
Ten A.M.
I'll be long gone.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
It's a town...
Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
What about the law?
And a pretty lady.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
It's none of your business.
I don't have any family any more.
It's been a while.
You're right.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
He left me.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I'm glad we talked.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
The public decides who's on that list.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Spare me.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I'll send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Even the fall from the plane?
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
That's true.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
Where are you?
Just a minute.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
You look so, so...
Simone?
You're with me to be close to her?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
It was more in passing.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You want me to call Security?
Good for you, Hank.
"Straw God" changed my life.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Me too.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
This should take care of Mother.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
You're in breach.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
No, just one.
No.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
I don't tell her a thing.
Why?
Something I want?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Yes.
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
When?
No.
What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
Lots of things.
Maybe.
They talk to you?
Stop it!
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
Superstition.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Which street corner?
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
"-- an AXE!"
"And a slash-slash there --"
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Then why go back now?
What are --
It's you. You and your father.
Never.
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
What'll we do?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Whatcha' doin'?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Starla, it ain't --
You took Bill.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
Shelby!
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Don't worry, Chief.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
What?
All the rib eyes?
It's just a work thing.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
If...?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
You paying for the gas?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
Eleven.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
How do you know?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
They're jammed!
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
We're gone.
Bandit?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Who's Fred?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Yeah.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
Okay.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Look at the collar on that coat...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I am. Yeah.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...He does now...
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
A million flat.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
-- never in a million girl --
Got hit twice.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
You're not Gibarian...
I want to hear your version.
Whose side are you on?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
How much sleep?
I don't know.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
Get out --
Stop it.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
You don't love me.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Don't call me that.
Thank you.
You're lying.
I can't --
Occasionally.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Beg pardon?
I'm sorry about what happened.
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
Yeah, what a woman.
You were reading my Renoir.
And "is"...?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
I'll think about Wednesday.
Do you?
Yeah...
Yeah.  It's all over.
I do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Claire...
I'm all right.
My ass is falling.  It is.
Get in bed.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
What's the difference?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm all right.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
It should've been me...
Call a cruiser!
No, I need'm now!
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
What the fuck you doin'?!
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hm.  What a lump.
They'll never take me alive.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Mr. Jameson--
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Even if they're not clever.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
Hurry up, Flash!
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You'd feel what?
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Waldos.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Use a fork.
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
I'll try. Thanks.
What?
Just drop me off here.
We did not.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Get going on the trap door.
So long, Sefton.
You stink, Sefton!
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
Why not?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
105-353.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Interesting.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
What's the award?
What do they always say?
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Borscht?
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Check.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
Yes, you do!
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
HoS qorDu. 
He is.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Thanks.
The station complement was nineteen.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
What's the "Nexus"?
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
I don't understand.
Yes, yes, it is.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
Phasing? To where?
What's normal?
No.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
Aye, sir.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
I went wrong.
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Short range scan.
Did your collaborator know?
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Well, all the same, I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Aye, sir!
... A cloaking device?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Report status!
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
No.
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Then, how --
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You're not going in there -- !
That's all you have to say?
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
And who am I hiding from?
Our first order of business is survival.
It's like the Garden of Eden...
Carol!
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Who --
But we can't just sit here -- !
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
What?
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Visual --
Inoperative.
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Admiral, this is Spock.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
How far?
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Yes --
Spock...!
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line?
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Scotty!
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
... My God...
Well nobody's perfect...
No, <u>my</u> name.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Go ahead.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Implicitly.
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
... Who are you?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Noon tomorrow...?!
But Kirk...
... Gone?!
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Whales?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
What are the variables...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
But you said toxic.
Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
How do you know this...?
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
I see.
He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
I will, Admiral.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Full power, sir.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.
That's the ticket, laddie.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
This way!
You're what?
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
May I talk to you alone?
I'll be in Engineering.
On screen.
We're through running from these bastards.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
We're not going anywhere.
Aye, sir.
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
We're trying to get to you, sir...
Gorch?
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Or you could try lying down.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I do not know what you are referring to.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Where?
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
Yes.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Are you always sucha good judge of character?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
No. It's a lot further than that.
You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you.  Don't stop now.
Aye, sir.
Onscreen.
Worf... torpedo... now!
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Emergency override!
Commander... we have a problem.
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
You may need assistance, doctor...
We're not finished.
Are we playing multiple choice?
More than ever.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I know what you mean...
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
Anything else you want to tell me?
Where do we come in?
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
I believe you. Please...
You can't prove any of this...
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
What?
You having hearing problems, mister?
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
I think  not.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
Dying?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
To happy endings.
And this makes you "sad"?
To new worlds...
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Fire!
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
Divert power and compensate.
Emergency force fields are holding.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
No!
Understood.
Theories?
That's an order, Commander.
Aye, sir.
On screen.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
Can anything be done for him?
We can only hope so.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
I have no reason to.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
Yes.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
We are.
And what of the Enterprise?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I am.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
It is... invigorating.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
We're being hailed.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Do as I tell you!
They will obey, Praetor.
Silence, Romulan!
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Thank you.
Stay right there...
Where's that?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Dashboard.
Gas good?
You'll see.
I know.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
You better.
I do not understand.
No.
When we get here.
A baby is a new person?
The captain...
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
No one's traveling in this weather.
Horses.
Yes, they are.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
We can.
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Hey buddy... let her go...
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Judy, that's stupid.
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Yeah, right.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Fuck you.
Make me forget it, baby.
Maybe.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Step into my office.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
I won't say anything.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
What else you got?
Well... the guy's fucked up.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Commissioner Strickland.
I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
She's my destiny.
You'll see.
No idea.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
It's not your fault.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
I'm not going.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I guess.
Are you going to make me beg?
Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
Besides that.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
What?
Winona.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Not as much as you'd think.
Hi. What's in the case?
You're a... you're sick.
What do you want from me?
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Speck. Harold Speck.
Go ahead.
What I do requires confidentiality.
How long ago?
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
Huh?, sir.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
A very sexy case.
The man knew how to dress.
Don't even go there. What's up?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Not yet. Not about this, either.
You did.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
What's going on?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Who told you about her?
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Follow me.]
If I owe, I will go.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
I want to go live with you.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Yes, sir.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
350 miles.
Take your shirt off.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Shuddup.
I'd say about two weeks.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
...Four days..?
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
What an asshole.
You have to lay it on the table.
Oh... right.
What do you do, Trent?
I understand.
Me too.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Fine... I guess. You?
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I don't talk about her that much.
I didn't mention her once today.
Classy.
Bud.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
Darwinism at its best.
I just tested for one...
Well, let's hit that party.
Oh, like that song...
It's unbelievable.
She wasn't your type anyway.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
Give me the money. I'll get it.
So, what? Eleven?
Not well.
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
Don't call me ever again.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Hang on, Voltaire.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Whu?
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
That's not cool.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What?!?
Always.
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
We didn't do so bad after all.
I'm telling you!
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
That was different.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
...a day...
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
We're not messing with you...
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
No.
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're like a big bear.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
An eye for an eye!
But your daughter is still alive.
Godfather.
Eat it, it's on the table.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
How bad will it be?
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
When did he call?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
For bravery.
And this?
What miracles you do for strangers.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You want him to stay in this country.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
How do you know I come from America?
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Give them some money and send them home.
Get rid of them...
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
Then the legs at the knees...
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
You know, a primer.
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
I played piano in a few places.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
What are you talking about?
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
Ripley's plans.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Oh God, I don't think so.
I love Marge.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What about Christmas?
Hardly.
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
What's going on?
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Frances?
So I'm learning.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Tom.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
I've never admitted that to anyone.
Okay then, you're crazy.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
You know what -- I am.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
Where have you been since then?
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's okay.
That's good, isn't it?
It's okay.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Huh?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
The singer?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
But this is a porno movie.
I'm getting a taxi.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
More people watch it.
With who?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Show me how he did that again.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
No.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
You said that?
A girl needs protection.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long.  That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
No.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Where is home?
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
How's your driving record?
Also clean.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Why do you ask?
Why?
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Shit.
Yeah?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
What's that?  Mason?
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
You mean,  me?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh...
Have you got a cigarette?
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Guess I must've learned.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
A super market.  Huh.
Nine and-a-half years...
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Why?
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Ha!
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Then I'll call you a cab.
She's very pretty.
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
That's not the country Luke fought for.
No thanks.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Not any more.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
What?
No.
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
I already have.
Who?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Yes, I did.
Would you like some brandy?
How do you like our little hamlet?
A trifle.
And what had you done?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Mom, they're in a cage!
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Morning.
That's where the Brenners live.
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Daniels.
Yes?
Thank you.
Shall I call the doctor?
She was selling birds.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
When do you think they'll come?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
When?
What happens when we run out of wood?
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
Yes.
That's all right.
Oh.
Aren't these lovebirds?
I didn't break that window!
What are you? A policeman?
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
Do you practice here?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
How do you know Annie?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Right next to the one you already had.
You are, aren't you?
Certainly, but...
Without any clothes on?
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
No, thank you.
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
What do you mean?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
...everything I know.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Wait here. Don't move.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Can we go on living here otherwise?
The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
MacFarlane
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
I remember her.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I would make you rich.
Now that is very interesting --  Take a chair, Joseph,
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
Nearly a year.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Tell her... we'll get him.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
Yeah. I sure will.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
I don't know you, man.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
He didn't kill her.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
I want you... to bend over.
You killed her!
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Okay.
What do you mean, dear?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No foolin'? Will you?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
About five months -- your months.
The present situation?
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
I feel different right now.
I want to know what he told you last night.
It won't work.
Where is the meeting going to be?
I -- I thought you were--
I'm sorry.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
You better get some fresh air.
You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
The meanest!
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
For a ride.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
I thought we were goin' into town.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
I'll pass.
Okay.
Gotta go, Mom.
What's that smell?
Smells like something died.
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
I hope so.
Star.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
Nanook...
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
I don't know who to trust.
Watch Clark.
Have you come across Fuchs?
You buy any of this, Blair?
Probably the next meal.
But...
We got morphine, don't we.
You been made, MacReady.
All in Norwegian.
I think so.
Thank you.
Well, stick to it.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
What happened?
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Morlocks --
Can you show us where they live?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Oh, shut up.
Yes... Thank you.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
How are your dreams now?
I will...
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
How do you control the Morlocks?
We make them see what we wish.
A man can change his history.
Because...
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Admiration?  My my.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Do you find her?
I would.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I don't understand.
Yes...
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Your husband is dead?
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Thank you...
You liked it there.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Did you have fires at night?
Yes.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Tell him to go away --
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Goodnight, Mr. Philby.
Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Temporarily.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
I never touched your father! I swear!
Yeah.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
I know.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I don't know.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
[Beat, lost] No.
Then, where are you going?
I still don't either, even after all these years.
You thought my father was crazy?
I'll die either way.
Because I don't have time.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How...how do you know?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
I don't think so.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
You want to come on in?
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
My Lord.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
What for?
Louise is alright.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Louise, honey... Where are you?  You sound funny.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Maybe.
I'm choking on it.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Oh yeah.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
In case of what?
So this is all my fault, is it.
You're not touchin' that car.
I think better when I drive.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I... I...
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
What little dogs?
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Harlan.
You do?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
No.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Grrrreat!
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Mints?
No.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
You got a brew?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
I beg your pardon?
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
A surprise?
Come on, what were you going to say?
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Any idea where I might start looking?
All you want is a phone number?
You want her dead, don't you?
Really?  Very, very?
No, not at all.
Huh?
Three different guys?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Uh, that's okay.
Good good.
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Do what?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
And you met Mary how?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
You were following us?
Oh. Well I am.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
He's no Steve Young.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Just a minute.
Who's that?
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
On your ear, you've got something.
Oh great, I ran out.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Mary, come on...
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
It.
She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Oh God.
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
Then you'll call, right?
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
What does the letter say?
Kenny. It's over.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Says what, Kenny?
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
This is from the Highest Authority?
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I know, I know...
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
That may be what they want us to think.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
I see.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Again. Figures, man.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Sioux Indian, right?
Good. Thank you.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
Yes.
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
Because he was talking to me.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
I don't see the connection.
Ray --
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Cuz you're a cop.
Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
Sorry.
1868...
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Do you want a coffee?
No. No, no. Thank you.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Yeow!
What would?
For what?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
How about what?
You don't have to kill it.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Are you really that brave?
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
Well no...inverse order.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
I want it back.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
And that's one!
Who's gonna win?
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
Well?
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
F-14's sir.
What is he doing?
You're crazy. We're level.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
BREAKING LEFT!
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
You go. I'm staying with it.
The plane is fine.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
This is Maverick.
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Don't.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
Yes sir.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Then why are you here?
For the same reason you are.
The flying. The fighting.  I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good.  Just give me the jet.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
It's not true.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
You got the job.
They've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what I say.
Get it, please.
So why am I still alive?
We gave you lots of help.  Benny here...
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Nice to meet you.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Where's Kuato?
You're Kuato, right?
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
Come on!
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Nobody.
Yeah, sweetheart?
Move to Mars.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
It's time you found out.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
Bullshit.
Mars.
Right.  Mars.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I think it's still hungry.
This is too weird.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The one in the mine!
It's just up ahead.
I gave you?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
You can't fight'em that way...
I think I scared it!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Civil?  I'm civil.
You are so full of shit...
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.
Yeah, geography.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
He was your snitch.
And one good guy.
Absolutely.
How can you remember that?
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Damn right I'm right.
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
-- Remember?
-- You found his mugshot?
-- What?
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I've seen this picture before.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
I haven't paid you.
I don't need sleep!
Want to tell me what went down here?
Afraid of what?
What went down?
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
I want you.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Don't get funny with me again.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Can you tell me what their names were?
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Was there an argument?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
Tell me about the letter.
No, sir, we did not.
Someone else has it now.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
What happened to her?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
It must be a high priority situation.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
You didn't do your homework?
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Donna, are you my best friend?
Dancing.
Cause I like it.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
But it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. She said he looked just like a boxer. Speaking of sandwiches... I think Bobby was arranging something for you...  Speaking of arrangements...  SPEAKING OF ARRANGEMENTS... Why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? Leo and I know that Santy Claus is coming to town... Thursday.
Why? It does.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What?
They were looking for wood.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
A special friend?
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
We're late to get to your mother.
Oh, Leland.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
That's right.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
And no one will know the truth.
I wouldn't do it.
Just as you are, Sir...
I know of him.
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
You may step down.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
We just...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...What difference would...
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors killed her.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
One hour.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
Listen to me, fella...
...and is that serious?
No, no, I'm just...
Is there going to be a later...?
It's over!
This is Miss Costello...?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
I'm going to get laid.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I can't talk now.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat...
The Hospital...?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes, the roving nurse...
Come on out!  We're friends!
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Maybe ...  Maybe they want to take us alive.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
You mean that was a...
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
No...
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Promise.  Cross my heart.  But until Mommy gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Here.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
I want to see for myself.
Listen, dammit.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
My child?  No...but...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Black's fine.
Yep.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You miss him.
I can take it.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
That's what they get for not locking the door.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
He does.
I just brought you something to eat.
Forget it.
Come on man, what'd they look like?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
I can't make it out?
What are you talking about.
All stop on the engine.
It was my fault.  I slipped.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
But you invited is aboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
I can show you how to use a slide rule.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Son of a bitch!!
What?
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
What makes you so sure it was one?
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
May I ask you something?
No.  I didn't.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
Yessir.
Twenty.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No, haven't heard of it.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Sorry to hear it.
No.
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
You heard from Reggie?
No shit?!?! You know him?
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
No sir...
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
I'm sorry.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
She got me an abortion...
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
They sure do stink.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Where?
I'm goin'.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Under a hundred.
You upset with me?
They have, sugar.
Trust me on it.
Fan works.
Yeah?
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Six.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Just tell me what you want.
Santos...
Yes.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
You really are one dumb asshole.
Thanks...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
How are you, Crabtree?
He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
Yes.
Shit.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Maybe... I don't know.
Only in your bones?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
So sensitive.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
...we find the jacket.
Call it a hunch.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
It's mine.
I have to see her. As soon as possible.
Who's got a gun?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
'Fraid so.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Sure.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
...You carry firearms.
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
So what are you doing out here?
Like the lady herself.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
You?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
What's he saying?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Who?
I never heard of it.
What kind of dancer?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
The hell I am.
And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
No thanks.
What would you call them then?
I don't know... 'Episodes.'
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Grady!
I got the message you called too.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Did you confess?
Would Walter really press charges?
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Does he still love you?
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Grady?
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Just kidding.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
No shit.
What party?
The birthday party.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
Sure.
Is that right?
That was terrific.
You live around here?
I'm not pretty.
It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
'Fraid not.
Yeah.
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
I don't mind.
What?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Of course.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
No fucking way.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
They usually tell me.
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
All right.
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
Since you've had sex?
The worst?
How many girls did you molest?
How young?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Bullshit.
Why not tell me now?
Which brother did this?
Not ever.
What?
What's your fucking problem?
Piece of cake, baby.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Wasn't up to me.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
No.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Now what?
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Wilhite, anything?
How deep?
Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Then why don't you try it on?
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
More so than the shark?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Then why do you say them?
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Have you ever been in love?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
To the shark.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
We'll try again.
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
He talked to you Himself?
No.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Why?
That's not what he meant.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
No I don't... the host is enough.
It made them holy.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
It's not my time of month.
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
Let's talk about something else.
Anything... may I sit down?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Right now?
Oh, I know he does.
I don't know.
And what did you do?
Where'd it come from before that?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Anything?
I've stopped menstruating
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Like what?
Do you?
Because I don't want one.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
Yes.
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She...
Yes.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
To help me.
Because I'm in trouble.
Did you know what was going to come out?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Who?
No.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
And the passage to the barn?
How did she know about him?
???
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Marie's dead Mama.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
What does this have to do with..?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Two packs a day.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Obviously there was.
Why haven't you asked her?
Why do you think that?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
So, someone else could have done it.
Who?
She stopped eating completely...
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
Yes.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Don't deny it!
The woman's health is at stake.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Would it stop you if I did?
No.
Why must he be anybody?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what I have to believe...
Is it because she's a nun?
No!
Before or after you killed the child?
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
I've made the scene.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Get him out of here!!
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
A butcher?
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
He's sulking again.
You crawler.
He hasn't.
He comes from a large family.
I'll look in here again.
Eh, there's only three of them.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Are you pulling my leg?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Have they?
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Eh?
But I'm clean.
For Ringo.
Hiding.
Shall I?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Oh you do, look.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
That's what you tell me.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
Clever.  George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
And they want me?
He can't be far.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Gravity?
Then take her down.
What is it, I can't --
Take care.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
Has the hull been breached?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
The water will still recycle.
Well we better do something.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
It wouldn't come.
Maybe it wasn't always dead.
Maybe we can catch it.
Can you do anything for him?
<u>How</u>?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Can you get them back?
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
Yes, thank heaven.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Look --
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Engine room, what happened?
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Anything else?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
Even simple.
Go ahead, Jay.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Kablooey.
Sure.
Do you want a tablet?
I told you we... what's that?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
Nooooo!
I'll come with you.
How?
Appreciate that.
Compensate!
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Only six?
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Hold on...
What can I do?
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
You should hit the sack, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
And what is your name?
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I am somebody.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Eddie what?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
She doesn't know.
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
We have that in common.
Then you two must have a long talk-
Amen.
In time she'll be what you are.
Where?
Everything... everything's so funny...
Thank you so much.
I'll try.
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
What?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
- guilty.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
I will not calm down!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Now don't get carried away-
I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
I've been aware of that for some time.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
A cowboy.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I don't have to. I want to.
It's only one picture deal.
Every day.
The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Your make-up's a little heavy.
What did you expect - live sables?
Behind in your dues? How much?
You don't like Eve, do you?
Night an' day.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
You were just looking around...
That's all.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
But the raves about your performance-
- an understudy's performance.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
They're your fans, your audience-
You've what?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
I detest cheap sentiment.
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
In a minute...
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Eve.
That was a pity...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Not much.
Where is she?
When you do, let me in on it.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Miss Caswell?  What?
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Fuck you, Carl.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
About the past year.
Anything you've got.
When?
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--I know, I know--
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Only everything...
--jeeeeeeesus--
Oh.
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
I'm so glad.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
Five hundred; six maybe.
It's right under that pile.
Hey, easy...
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
Something maybe big.
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
...check...?
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
Who's Colson, Harry?
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
Haldeman.  Right?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Yep.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
That's nice.
Onions?
You want onions?
I know.  Salt and pepper?
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
I know, it sucks!
What?  We both have cars.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
...I've never tried it.
You got it, stud.
Do you?
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
You fuckin' rule!
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Okay!
She's a mermaid, dude.
C-Span?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Me?
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
You think so?
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
But you don't love me.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Yep.
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
I know. He told me.
What?! He told you? When?
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
What about me?
Yeah?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
I told him it wasn't ready...
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Now!
He says -
Merde.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I know, but I had to because . . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
Don't be
No! Well, yes, but
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
He's her?
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
No. Empress, you --
She does.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
Alvy Singer over here!
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
Tsch.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
How can you possibly oversleep?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Hey, that was last year.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, right.
Yeah, my grammy.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Well...
Well... thank you again.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Here, you want some?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
M'hm.
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah?
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
No, I'm fine.
Yeah.
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Oh.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
It was just great!
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Yeah?
What?
Yeah?
Yeah, but it's real close.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What-
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Are you?
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Who said that?
What are you depressed about?
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Hey.
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Forget it, Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Well, sit down.
M'hm.
Yeah. Right.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We really had a good time.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Would it make a difference?
Had a little help?
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
No, what?
It's alright, isn't it?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
He's allergic.
Well, probably.
I'd say it was down.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
Really.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I never put myself in harm's way.
Anymore.
Harry called.
Leave us alone right now.
Forget it, Judy.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
It was fifteen seconds.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
Whatever you say.
Did he promise?
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
I'm going to throw up.
Really?
Well he can't have gone far.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
Anyone else?
I'll never forgive you.
Everybody hates the messenger.
It's a Calder.
I know.
Will you make love with me?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Don't be silly.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
You're an interior decorator, right?
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Elitism?
We're way past inappropriate.
Medallions.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Let's just go home, okay?
Oh?
Yes.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
No, no thanks.
The charades.
Really??
Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.
Yeah.
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Not enough.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
Thanks.
So tell me, how's it going?
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
What are they?
I don't mind...
Relax.  You've done enough.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
I hope they're watercolors!
The both of you.
Oh Soph...
And the food sucks, I know.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
You -- you think I'm right?
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Worker!  Come back here now!
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
There's something going on, Z --
Oh no...
I'm the Princess, aren't I?
You did?
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
ONE TO NOTHING!
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
My mother.
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
What did I tell you?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Good night.
Would you like to?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
You shouldn't.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
No -- I don't want anything.
In his apartment.
A cemetery?
Gin.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
What for?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Do I have to?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Oh.
You did?
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
The dishes?
I mean, after that?
We're going to finish that gin game.
So I want you to keep a clear head.
I never thought he'd do it.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
I'm fine.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Oh?  Oh!
Not that I have anything to hide.
Well -- I guess so.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yes, sir.
I got kicked in the head, too.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Happy New Year.
Family?
No.
No kidding.
I'm with you, lover.
Good night?
Doctor.
I don't know.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Call me what, sir?
I don't believe you --
Probably is.
That we're dumber than we look.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Signs?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Charlie?
No, I've seen those in Normandy. This is much better.  My country -- my country could never originate this. Magnificent.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
How big it is?
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Can you trust them?
Who knows.
Don't you agree?
Who?
I'm Kurtz.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
Fuck no.
And you admired him?
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
What?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
Sure.
No -- leave it --
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Keep back.
She's dead.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
That's not what I meant.
-- Permanently?
That's my line.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
That makes the flight more interesting.
That's right.  You're not.
I don't plan on dying.
How many do you see?
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
You broke the radio, remember?
You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
Shut up!
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
I got it from here.  Thanks.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Any idea who could've done it?
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Uh-huh.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Emergency room only.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
I've got Jews at my table.
Okay.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
No!!! Stay away from me!
Why did yo do this for me?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Lovely.
Thank you.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
And?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Go ahead.
So long.
What job?
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Yes. I really would.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
All right, cut me a break.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Don't want to. I love you.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Do it.
Wait here.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Get out.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah.
What?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Sure.
Sick.  The flu.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Know what?
One hour per man.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
So this is something between you and him?
Why?
Because he is trying to retire me.
Right.
Why?
Why didn't you finish this game?
I was just different.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Did it ever bother you?
No.  Something honest.
Nothing.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Thank you.
Fine.
But he won't shoot you right then?
Okay.  Then what?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
You didn't take it.
I think I got one today.
So?
What?
Jesus, if someone had --
Nobody ever sees me.
Thank you.
What?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Attraction is a complication?
Did you --
Yes.  Please come in.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
A dime.
Shit... oh well.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Go ahead.
No.
This will take some time.
I have all day.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
But we are underground?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
He was an electrician?
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
Thought of everything haven't you.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
You'd be better off with tables and chairs.
So why didn't we?
No, the boyfriend.
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
What are you on about?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine.  Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
That bad?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Siberia.
What do you want me to do?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Some deal you did there!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Yeah, pretty well.
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I've been around.
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
No way Doug, I can't.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Sure, I've done it easily.
Okay.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Great....How long will it go for?
About forty minutes.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
How do I know what's being said?
Thanks.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Yeah seems okay.
Guests.
A kind of freedom.
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
Go to hell!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Can we talk in your office?
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
And what of these foreigners?
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
No. I won't be long.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
That'd be something.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I'm just wondering --
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
So you agree you need help?
Kinda. Yeah.
It's private.
Ambitious.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The dirty snowball at its core.
In ten words or less?
No.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Healthy as can be.
It's not.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I will.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
He wants help with his lines --
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Up to?
Dad --
Like what, sir?
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Yes.
That's right. You just act like one.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Are you?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
This is 1952....?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Uh, hi....
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Coming, Eileen...
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Oh yeah.
In the parking lot, with her.
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
Operator, what's today's date?
March 11th.
Oh, right, right... 
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
That's just great!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Well, he's gone.
Can't afford to take chances.
Not bad.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Does he bite?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Good luck to you.
I mean it.
What're you doing?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Quit my job.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
But it would hurt.
I can look and see.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Why?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How's he doing?
It was going too fast.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Hold it right there.
Beats me.
Planet 10?
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
To get my guns.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Everybody okay up here?
Pretty terrible shot.
Oh, my.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
You look!  It's not here!
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Better than him.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Flying to Cambodia.
Bet I do.
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Barton!
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
...Who is this?
...Who?
What DID you mean?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Are you all right?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
Who?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Pictures! Jesus!
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Hi, Charlie.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
Yeah.
Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
Mr. Lipnik.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Yes sir, they 
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
All of which he's now missin'.
We got a treatment on it yet?
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
What was she like in school?
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Yes.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
That's right.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Why not?
It's not the same thing, is it?
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
She's seen everything before.
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
I know.
No?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Of course I knew.
Liar.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Really.  What are you writing about.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Why would I need an attorney?
Yes I am.
How's that?
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Do you remember his name?
Nilsen?
I hope I helped you out.
I got tired of being played with.
What is it you got between you?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I know what that's like.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
You're my friend, Gus.
Catherine told me what was in it.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Is he dead?
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
It's yours.
Are you vice?
I'm a painter, too.
I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
That's good. At least they're interested.
What's wrong?
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
They're just words.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
SAMO.
Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Well thanks!
You're your own baby.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Stand still.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Alright, thanks.
I think I'll take the stairs.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
You first.
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Too late for what, dear child?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Yes?
Women.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
Keep it.
Why?
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Surf's up.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Definitely.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
I wouldn't bet on that.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
What did you say?
He ran away?
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
...A bat.
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
Just checking, young sir.
You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
La'chiem.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Excuse me.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
You do know. Try.
Excuse me.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Bruce, you can't.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Fred?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
A man with a death wish.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Mm-hmm.  Lunch.  Not even dinner.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
About how pretty you are, pretty boy.  Maybe he'd like to know --
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Oh, Bruce...
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Allie, he's not.
Not what?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
And what did you say?
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Meaning?
oh dear.
Well, Ahm....
Great - keep him out of trouble.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
Mmmmm...
What makes you say that?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Yes?
Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Cool, huh huh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Turd-burglar...
Bunghole...
Uh, Butt-Head.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
... Hmmm?
Maybe this is heaven.
At least we won't have to worry about her.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
That's all we need.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Now, let's get rolling!
We need help.  We deserve help.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
No.  You don't want his help.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
They're dead.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Good girrrl!
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
Let me have it.
Stepmother's...
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Otho, can you do it?
Any particular kind?
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
Viridian?  What is...?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
But not for long...
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
Oh, really?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
A Black man gave me the message.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Your leg must be getting better.
Yes. I was.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Oh, good.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Yes. I like that name very much.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Bravo!
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
No, Ben.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes.
Yes.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
Yes.
I see.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
I see...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Yes, I understand.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
Yes, I will.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
Yes. I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
No headaches?
That's good... That's good.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
... Would you take me on a tour?
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
... Well?
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Okay.
Yeah.
Enjoy.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
May 11th.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
She's very beautiful.
Hi.
Yeah. You want a beer?
'kay.
I want to try.
What?
Now?
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
What?
You've always loved the animals.
Yes.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Shut up!
It'll never happen, fuckface.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
No.
Yessir.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Emily Dickinson.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
What's he been in?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
My God.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hush, sweetheart.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Vegas? What'd you think?
Why are you being like this?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Do you mind?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Aw, Baby.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Oh.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
You sure?
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
It's her, ain't it?
Aw, no, Ella.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
Till she showed herself.
You?
Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
I don't want to know.
Yeah. Look bad?
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Make it the way I always do.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
Oh, man, don't say that..
But I guess she told Dieter.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
ANTI-SEMITE!
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
That is for the urn.
Huh?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
I see.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
"Johnson"?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Take a look at this, sir.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
Is he pretending to be the abductor?
Delayed after-eff--
Mmnun.
Uh-huh.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
I want a child.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Am I wrong!
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
No, you're not wrong--
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Huh?
Uzi?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Uh-huh.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
The House of Pain.
Nothing.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
I want to see the sun rise.
Took you long enough.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Not that I'm in contact with.
Look, what's your problem?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
How can you be out here?
How do I stop it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Like me.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Cancer.
Some. It's been slow --
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
I was afraid that might happen.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
You don't have to be.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Sometimes --
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
What're you doing there?
The Witch's voice.
Not the only things missing, Nick.
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I want to see the tapes.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
Looks like a rope.
I can't let you in.
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Try a long walk.
--coming out of the water--
Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my loft--more the fucking merrier.
What?
--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
How's she going to know where to--
--who?
<u>What</u>?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
What're you nuts--
One of the printers.
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
No. I don't think so.
Why she kills children.
Then I have no idea.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
What?
Sure. I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Okay. Hypothetically.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
Does she, goddamnit??
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Well I do...
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
...Mm-hmm.
What do you want to know?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I told you. I like you.
No.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What're you, a fucking marriage counselor?
How long did you watch her?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
Got a job for you.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
I want you to go fishing.
...What?
Red Label.
Pour that back.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Yes.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No.
I'll go then.
See my breasts?  . See?
Do you know?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Hello.
Yes. Frank-
Frank is coming?
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
Kiss me.
Just get outta my bed.
No. it's not Don.
You called me Jeffrey.
It's okay. it's okay.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
There ya go.
Am I bothering you?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
I don't know. he moved away.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey?. Why?
I can't dance fast.
uh uh.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Excuse me?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
We want some grass.
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Nice doing business with you, George.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
For calling you a homo.
Murder.
Oh my G-d.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Diego?  It's George.
Yeah, I'm out.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Just sell it, Derek.
Just a friend.
You fucked me, Diego.
Today.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Oh, I see.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
I'm sorry, George.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Good.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
But this is...
Alright.
Out.
You can call me Dad if you want.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
Swear on my life.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
And you believe the NLF?
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Third group.
Of course. As soon as possible.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Let's hope forever.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I'm trying.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
You got something on the Coke?
How?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Counsel approach the bench.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
You've been following me?
A little after eleven.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
Yes.
What did Mr. Marsh say?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
And how are you now?
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Why?
Cocaine.
No further questions.
No.
Chinese peony root.
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Then what happened?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
No.
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Yes.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Why didn't you live together?
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
What?
Yeah.
Why?
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Mr. Roston?
You better.  Please answer the question.
If you want me to.
Yes.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
What time did you leave?
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Well, I can help.
He's not coming.
What?
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
No, I don't think so. I --
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Not this kind of heat.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
Francesca. Robert.
Sure.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
Why, do you think?
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
But no one in particular.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Wonderful. Uh...
Yes.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
No, I don't mind.
What?
How do you know what I experience?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Sure.
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Yes, they are.
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I said, no thanks.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You mean as opposed to your life?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Lucky thing.
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
Here!
I can't!
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What building?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
What's that, Johnnie?
I think you're fucking crazy!
Stay away!
What the fuck is going on?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
We're going to need some time.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
They were in a car accident.
Where is it?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
All right.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Good guess.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
My pleasure.
What do you want?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Tell me about it.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
How did you meet him?
How long have you been with him?
Five years is a long time.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
Because it's the truth.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
I think so, too.
Yes.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
To let it dry.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Yes.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
I don't know.
So it's time to go home.
Keep it. 
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?

You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Jason...
You got me pretty fucking curious.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
Go ahead.
-- let me do this, okay? --
You knew he was coming.
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Not really.
So get the hell out of here.
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact, I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
-- here we go -- I found it --
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
What?
Get everyone down in the basement.
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
All of them?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I don't know.
Thank you.
I fixed it myself.
...elephoned sir.
... fix themselves.
Got there!
...aven't you?
...sod you, stupid twit.
What? How do you know my name?
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Well ... well, I ...
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Even later.
What?
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You got the wrong man.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Take her off the list.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
If you say so.
You think these are tits don't you?
Oh.
It's you ... it's you ...
Good!
Oh, sorry.
It does doesn't it?
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
"And your children all gone."
What?
What a BITCH!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Try next of kin.
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Um ...
Thank you for calling Cen -
Numero, trois.
What is it?
Ha!!
But ... I called Central Services.
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
No, no, that's impossible.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He looks like a cop.
Got a beer?
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
John, play the Sinatra.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
How is she?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
You married?
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
What do you want to break?
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
You learn that in the army?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
You know what. The radio.
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
And the rule was...
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
What?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
No?
I'll put her on.
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
A half hour in the lobby.
Call if you get weird.
Watch? --
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Did it really go well?
Aaron, will you tell me?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Sit down, stop.
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Your hair's a little funny.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Thanks.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
Yes.
Should I...
Just a two-second dissolve.
One's enough.
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
It's Paul.
You don't have to finish tonight.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Well, what is it?
Uh-huh.
We can go together.
Who?
That's not it.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Not anymore!
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
A thing I made.
Me too.
There there...
Are you ready?
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Just about anything, Walter.
What?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Don't ask.
I know, man.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Let's check out the scene.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Yeah.
Well I don't know -
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I-I already got a new one!
Just wait till you see this!
No...look I'm busy...
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
"Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
Uh, I don't know.
Good morning Walter!
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Coach knows what abs are?
Yes!
Suck!
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
We hate you guys!
Don't tread on the earth?
Yeah?
What's Bobby gonna say?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Mmmnkay.
Nothing.
Come on, what was it?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I should have known.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
Like my homework.
Please.  It's so '91.
Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Time to do what?
In Virginia.
China.
Lothos.
I have to show you.
All right.  What do we do now?
I have cheerleading squad.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
What?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
Same one.
A what?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
As for example, what?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Could be.
Good.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Does Jeffrey know?
Wit-tay.
You want some punch?
Oh, please.
Right.
No...  You want me to give him a message?
All right.  Take care of yourself.
I am.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
Catch?
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Nuke?!
No.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
He did?
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
Don't worry.
I'll learn.  C'mon--
So...Wanta make love?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Who?
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I heard already.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
I can do that, too.
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
Ninety-five miles an hour...
You got a live arm there.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
You a God damn witch?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
It was a cocksucking call!
Beg me!
Beg me again!
Don't think.
Gimme that.
Yep.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
My right.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
No way.
We'll pray anyway.
It's a league record.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Now, instead of the cops only lookin' at Nicky, they started looking at Green too. And he was supposed to be our squeaky...
You were wandering around.
Yes, you were.
You got it.
All right, take care.
Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Okay.
I can't! I'm tied!
If his girlfriend was knocked up.
Yeah.
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Then he called me a faggot.
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
In so many words, yes.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Hey, she came to talk...
Please...
Okay?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Well...
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
Well, sir, I was just...
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Thanks a lot.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Yeah.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Okay.
Oh, it's so soft.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
What's it...
Pretty serious.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
You're not takin' Amy.
Get out of here!
I had a... salad.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You fuckin' whore!
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
I am not!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
A record of the arrests...
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Green?
Can you do it with your left hand?
Yeah?
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
I can't.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Here we go!
It's instinctive, you know.
He's not here?
Carmine's gone.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Are you sure?
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Yeah, no shit.
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Sure.
All right?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
I'll be there.
Okay.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
All right. Be careful.
Okay, yeah.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
I am.
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
You do?
No, I'm gonna drive.
...they're in Penthouse K.
All right.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
You know why, right?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
She asleep?
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Angelo and Buster.
They'll do it.
Yeah.
Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
No, no, no, no!
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Oh, sorry -
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Yeah.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
It's okay. Let her go.
I wonder..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
You're serious?  You'd help me...
I lied.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Absolutely.
Now he'll be up all night...
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
You can't get away with..
Whatever you say...Sis.
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
Enough.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Actually, yes.
Like you don't know...
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
Then whose is it?
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
And stop with the directions.
Make a "U" and go back.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't want to know --
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Shit!
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
Sometimes I paint.
A price on everything.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Why tell me this?
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Yes.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
He wants 75 back.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
You're the man with the gun.
Only one way to find out.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
You won't live to see it.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Didn't we play this scene before?
We can be there.
Some loyalty.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I still don't see you.
My pleasure --
Negative.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
Don't worry.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Take the 405 south.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
You fucking did.
Cunt.
It's Dave.
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
Who?
How'd you guess?
Jimmy?
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
They all get the wrong idea.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
You can't leave me then, can you?
As different as it's possible to be.
Yes.
He did sometimes.
All the time.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Whenever. Tonight.
Sorry.
Probably.
Are you pretending yet?
Kind of.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
She from Scotland too?
You got the keys to the shop?
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Prescription. For my condition.
Are you listening?
Try and go, then.
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
What happened to Jimmy?
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Someone's got to do it.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Yes?
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Why?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Should blow you away, you know that?
And who is she?
Can't.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
No?
So I've noticed.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
No, what's the funny thing?
Don't you think of it, fucker.
No?
She your wife?
Don't I know it.
Can't. Once I signed up.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
I'll bear that in mind.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I don't know her.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Hurling --
Whatever you say, Jude...
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Give me the fucking shooter!
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
No -- I guess not.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Very sweet.
Ours.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Describe him.
No, what?
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
I said with the mouth shut.
Okay -- up there.
I'll take that.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
There must be some way.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
Said what?
Okay.
You did.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Or Tex?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Alex --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
Why don't you shut up!
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
How much is it worth?
And the last one?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I'm very confused.
And this? And this?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I found it! I found it!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Thank you.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
Don't you want me to stay?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
He took care of Charlie for us.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Not my imports.
I get the imports.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You're grounded Friday night!
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
No honey.
You are upset.
No.

Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
I'm sure you should have failed.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
I was desperate. It was gross.
OK. increase the peace.
What party?
No.
I won't.
Stag?
I can't right now.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
What?
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I don't know. I kind of am.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Not that I know of.
The principal?
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
You want cash?
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
Yeah, borrowed!
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.

...-ed.
 Yeah...
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
...man!
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
I think...

Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
God, man!
Left, left, left!
...Pete!  Come on.
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on...
Whoo!
 Gee, you think so?
Come on.
Yeah...


Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.
...to him!  You don't know who...

What?
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.

...man.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Put your hand in my pants.
Hang...
...on!
 


Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!

Always the negative...
Hello.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That was quick.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
This country trained me to kill...
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
Us.  Owe us. 
However, you are also non-en-...
...-lar.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
I can't say it's a surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY.
You know the suspect?
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
...time to time, yeah.
...though.
...to die for a country that's...
Him first.


Where's Elvis?!

...it.
Kabula's out.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY. 
...tight!
Here's what I want you to do.
...colonel?
Run a check.  FBI, Interpol.
It could be a cover, I suppose.
...like a fish.
...is a perfect hunter.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...fishin'.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Okay, I'll have a chopper meet you at the top.
Do you recognize this young man?
His name's Vitelli.  Talk to him.  He's right out-...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?

 
Yeah, I'm sure.
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

...-damn phone.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
An honest living.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Thanks.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Was he right?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Ain't worth thinking about.
No thanks.
Plus what I owe you?
You sure this is okay?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Oh... thank you.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Never forgave him for what?
No, I think I'd remember.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Working for the District Attorney.
Yeah.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
To Mexico...
...where does Kyo live?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Never?
That's a long fall.
Mr. Gittes...
I'm afraid so.
I am sorry.
He's not in, Mr.?
They were partners.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
Neither do I.
Well, you never know, do you?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
So I can have these? 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
But you don't have any kids!!!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Too bad!
Why? What do you mean?
What's she like? What's she like?...
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
Two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
Hmm!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
You really don't know who I am?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
At night?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
I'm not sorry.
No, you're not.
Where'm I going?
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Are you finished?
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
All we saw on that screen was a big American -
Yes, sir.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
Rosebud?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You think I'm shitting you...
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
No, this is great.
Why aren't there any lights?
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
I'm just kidding.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
Call the police.
Yeah.
Excuse me?
They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
Five years.
That girl was vile to you.
Oh yeah.
What about Veronica?
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
More or less.
There's more?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Wait.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Nudie booth?
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
See? There you go again.
Can we not talk about this?
No, you're not.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
I don't want to talk to you.
You want to rent a movie.
Jesus!
Please, get the hell out of here.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
No way!
Living proof.
I don't; you did.
You're lying.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
I'm not.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
I'll read the book.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Could be.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
One seventy-nine.
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
She's my girlfriend.
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Actually, that's his night job.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Why did you agree to come in then?
Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
What were you doing?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
How do you figure?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
Yeah, right.
How many?
Something like thirty-six.
Um. Thirty-seven.
I feel sick.
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
What're you talking about?
A couple...?
Fuck you.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
You said you were here all day?
Check this out, he's from Russia.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
He is.
Feel that.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
Bye  That was Snowball.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
What usually eats a banana?
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
I did what I thought was right.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Give him the money.
Fine, I guess...
One...
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
Where've you been?
I don't understand?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Flare up of old emotions...
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
He doesn't want my help.
What are you doing here!?
You got to go back now!
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
It was great.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Up ahead.
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
Never, what?!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
I don't know.  I don't know.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Never could save a thing.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Ask the questions.
Kill him when he gets down.
Richard Travers.
What did you do that for?
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Thank you, sir.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
No, brother. What d'you want?
No, sir.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
C of E, sir.
Lice?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Fine... fine.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Yes!!!
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Yes.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Indeed.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Prison custody?
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Carry on, Chief.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Dozen times a day.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Can't say that I do.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
What?  What did you say?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
I don't know...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
So?  It was a random thing.
Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
Pick me up in five minutes.
It's nothing.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
He paid for 'em.
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
You should start a union.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
How can you kill him like that?
Good luck.  You think they got families?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Collateral damage.
You mind?  I'm working here.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
What you mean, no?
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Good excuse.  How many others you got?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
Makes two of us.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
...indifferent.
As in...? 
None of your business.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Who?
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
The guy came right at us!
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Do you still ride?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Yeah.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Six months.  Eleven days.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
I've been reading up on it.
Can you prove any of this?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Shoot.
Not this again.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
Where then?
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Thanks.
Where are we going, Jerry?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
Come on.
Where were you the day he died?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
You saw me standing alone ...
Don't do this.
Now she tells me.
I don't know...
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
<u>Why you</u>?
The truth shall make you free.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Working.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
What the hell does that mean?
What do you mean?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Yes, sir.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Ellie...
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
It's beautiful.
Is that your official response?
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
No more stalling, Captain.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
I didn't realize I was out.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Make that two.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
What'd you think?
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Oh.  I brought you something.
Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
But --
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Cut that backsass!
Buck is a deal.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
No.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I... I... I...
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
She's got him! You hear that?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Pair'a nines.
I just always did like truck rides.
We got it locked in the sock.
Cuter.
Cuter again.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you want him.  The cute brutal type with handcuffs.  Very sexy.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
I never carried a gun!
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
She don't want it.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
My promise.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
We could use a little help.
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
Did you come?
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
You should have gone to the funeral.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Have you seen his penis?
So - why the airport?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
You're kidding.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
I don't want to hear anymore.
There's nothing to tell.
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Truly.
It'll be fine.
Oh, no, of course not.
I didn't say...
But what am I going to do?
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I guess so. I think that's right.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
That must be really difficult.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
No rounds for another three hours.
What's my rap?
That's where I always go when I get out.
I have a terrible confession.
Home free.
Not a one.
All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
It's sex time.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
How about a dance?
Always the drugs.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
How about something better?   Like a kiss.
I'm calling in sick.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Sure. Why?
I think we need to talk about some things.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
So will you?
That's a load off my mind.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Here's the ring.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
I'm glad you're doing well.
I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
Oui.
Should I call you back?
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
What kind of business?
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
And the other car?
The Holiday Hotel.
Go where?   The police are outside.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
No.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
They sort of got away.
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Watch this.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
You ask a lot of questions.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
What's it to you?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Put them down.
Do you know her?
I have a guest.
You're probably right.
I'm bored.
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
Give it back!
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
You coward!
I don't take orders from anyone.
It is trouble for me.
I will.
It has.  How's business?
Perhaps.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
What does it say?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's only a flesh wound.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
Mister Funboy lives there?
I think he's yours, now.
In a better place.  I hope.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Well, how's your friend?
I don't know you...
You don't even remember...
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Miss her?
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
The night is young.
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
I'll be fine.
Junior.
Got a boyfriend back home?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You talking to me?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Please.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Why not?
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
That's also none of your business.
Yes.
What?
Okay?
I will.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
You must take me for a real idiot.
Fine.
Not at all. Have a seat.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Why can't we be together?
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Sure.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
What do you mean?
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
What are you scared of?
It was nothing.
Is it that obvious?
I don't know.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Best friends.
Does your mother know?
Well did you like it?
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
I am?
Of course. I'm not a monster.
But -
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
No.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
Sounds intriguing.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Okay.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
But who will they turn to for help?
Have you succeeded in your task?
What's your problem?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
So? How'd it go last night?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Oh yes.
Excuse me?
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Ronald?
Will you calm down?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
That's beautiful.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Well please leave a message that I called.
What are you talking about?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
Well, it seemed to me --
You're shouting at me.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
Where did you mail them?
I'll show you.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
Why didn't you run after them?
It was just a voice.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
Yes, Amy?
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
This is more fun than just pretend.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
But she's dead!
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Yes, Amy.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Good.
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Look at me.
My daughter died long ago.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
Mom!
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
Frida, grab that red one.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And then?
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
It is so hot in here.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Frida? You okay?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Knock what off?
So pee? Here?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Take your shower.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
There's a lot of that going around.
No, she died when I was twelve.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Oh my god, by wolves?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Goodnight.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
No, it was our first date.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
The other one?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Don't know that either.
What is going on?
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Not that again...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
You're kidding?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
No...
Share...
Nightmare...
Like how?
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Bob...
Then we'll all go to jail together.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car.
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
Fine.
She knows.
Why?
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
I can't say.
Of course.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Mind if I sit down?
You weren't in the state legislature.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
You really believe that?
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
... Me, too.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Leave him.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
That sounds like a curse to me.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
Come on!
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
What'dya get?
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
But why?
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
So?
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It should, but I found it and now I claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  Seize the cave.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
The pleasure is mine.
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Courtyard?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
That's miles.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
Do you have to quit the play?
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
And where is our point of arrival?
And no questions asked.
He's with them.
You hear that?
Seen a lot of islands?
You're saying they can think?
I'm saying they're calling the shots...
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
I don't know...you got what we need?
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
You want some too?
Maybe plans changed...
Plans don't change...
Shut up!
John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Jesus, it's freezing!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
I do!!!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
You mean...?
I came to see Merle.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Vince!!!
Inside, Vince.
Biederman, yes.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
What?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
We... Three bullets.
Right.
So do I.
You do?
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
What else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
What do you mean?
Here! This is it!
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
Right.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
What's that noise?
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
The fuck I did!!!
I can smell it.
What did you say?
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
And I want Doucet.
Where?
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Drop it.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
Simulated one.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
...Have you been drinking?
If you were set up, I want to find out who did it.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
No you don't.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Belle --
I didn't.
You know that you're in my house.
That's my problem, Belle.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
And serve him right!
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
What Grange?
Afraid ... of what?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Well, I'll be -- 
I don't care.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
There's no joy in it for me.
Shall we?
Yes.
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
How much?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Who is it?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
I am going to lock him up.
Mary!
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I dunno.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
You mean -- a jury trial?
I object.
I can't be honest with them.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
What are you going to do?
Tell me about it.
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
New York...
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
So I've heard.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
They're all yours, Al.  Good luck.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Yessir.
Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
It's okay... it's okay...
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah...
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
Denmark?  Sweden?
I know I am.  I know!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah.
Are they on the phone still?
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
What kind of things, Leon?
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
You think it over, Leon.
What are you doin' in there?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
How many you got in there?
I got Sal.
Call me Sonny-boy.
Okay, give us the women.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
... armed robbery ...
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
I don't know.
No you don't.
Yeah.
What now, Sonny?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Yes...
How'd that happen?
But do you mean it?

They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
Bullshit!
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Oh.  Run.
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Newsman, not ...
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Chinga te y tu mama tambien.</i>
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>

Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
She went up to her room.
Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, "Excuse me?"
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
I'm going with you.
He's just being nice.
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
Fuck!  My money!
Don't worry about it.
That's my name.

Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Make dat money.  Get paid.
Before I get off work.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.

I'm listening.

I love you, Black.
Sez me.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Actually we have something for you.
Yeah, I think.
Excuse me.
Yeah. How'd you know?
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
You and Lloyd chose the class!?
Come over around seven.
Gotcha.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Right.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
No no no no no.
Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...

What?
Shut up!
You take that back!
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
I'm sure you're overreacting.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY!
No. What happened?
I know I did.
Well, I'm listening now.
I... found that rock.
I don't know who we are anymore.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Damn! What are the odds?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Oh I think you do.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
That's it. I'm done.
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
He passed away three years ago.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Just like the President.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
This band sounds terrible.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Yes.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
We call that one Muad'dib.
Pain.
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
Did they try and fail?
I predict we're lost.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I have no next picture.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
But maybe not.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Don't let me slow you down.
Don't you have any savings?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
No!  A horror movie star!
Boris Karloff!?
It takes me comfortable.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
But there's plenty of other parts.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
I think you're quite handsome.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Are you a fruit?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
How long's he been here?
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
No! I love sex with girls.
Oh.  Okay.
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Yeah...  I should give her a call.
Who's Dr. Tom?
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
What's uncanny?
YES!  JUST DO IT!
You know, to make the legs move --
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You're nuts.
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
No, uh...
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
Mom?
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
It was horrible. He called me up.
But Al is your husband now!
I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
I batted!
Well, then I'm quitting.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
What?
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No. It's your fault.
Everybody's someone.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Yeah.
We'd better go...
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
I know.
Me?!
Do you still have it?
What?... Why?
Thanks... That's ...
Hm?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
What does that have to do with... ?
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
In love?
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
You guys have fun?
You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
You bet.
Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
Looks like Tim Kobza.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Looks like today's your lucky day
Yes?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
Exactly when?
Door was open.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Here?
More this way.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
So?
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
What do you mean?
Thought what?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Don't you fucking knock?
What'd I do?
What's it to you?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
It's Lynn.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
It's Bud.
That simple, huh?
In the morning.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
How'd you get them to retract?
I got to write my report first.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Against your code?
I got her address.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
I don't know.  I swear it!
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And?
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
And now you'll provide them.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
So what's the point?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
Why's she seeing Bud White?
No.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
I know how he feels.
When?
Under the house.
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
Down around my ankles.
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Yeah.
Something like that.
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Why?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
One-twenty.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Looks like Detroit.
Who?
Oh my God...
We're not gonna hurt you.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
The robbery.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
I can't.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Was he with anyone?
You should take this seriously.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
It's okay.
I know.
Stacy--
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
What happened to your head?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
You did good.
Brill.
Brill?
We're screwed.
I've never met him?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We believe he did.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Seat 74.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Why?
Dad!
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
I love my blender.
What?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
Bobby--
Calm down.
Yes.
Jesus.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
You're tired.
Turn yourself in.
Tell me about it.
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
What about the tapes?
There was a transfer.
Who?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Do you have visual?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Yes sir.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
I do not.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
This is empty, just coming!
You bastard, I was believing you!
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Still a car.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
I see.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Her hands and feet were tied.
What did you do?
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Don't be so bloody nave.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
No.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
You were in Africa?
Yeah, for a while.
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Fine.  I'm not looking.
Ask him.
I can get in the back.
For?
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Well, she is!
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Candaules
How?  How can you see anything?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Kip's another one.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Only we have to go to work.
Does he have to go?
I had a hotel room.
How awful.  What will you do?
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
I don't think so.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
The windows don't open.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
You got a better idea?
It's sold.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
So what?
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm not the one to ask...
I'm a thief. Sue me.
What's my problem? You want a list?
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Good morning.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
No. It's a down payment.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Yes you did.
Charged?
Thank you.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Yes. Yes.
You don't know the half of it.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Charged.
That's because you grew up rich.
They drive so recklessly there.
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
The disc is still in there.
I'm not leaving without you.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
In the van.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Black of course.
Call it an expression of trust.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Don't use language with me --
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Who?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
Yeah.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
For what?
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
Yup.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
Oh, yeah?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
So what made you think it was?
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Not in my world.
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Say you were wrong.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Did he say why?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Whose number do you need?
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Cause I don't even know you.
How?
I'm gonna clean it up.
How would you know?
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
What's that?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
What?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
The boy is our last hope.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
I can help them!
I feel The Force.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Because of my father, I guess.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Does Luke know?
Yes.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
I'm against that.
Now you're making sense.
Where have I heard that before?
Yes, you do.
The entrance is collapsing!
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
I'm sorry too.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Closer?!
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Let's go.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
You are reckless!
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
And I too.
It won't get through the blockade.
Believe what?
That primitive apes can talk.
Humans?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Give it.
You told me he was dead.
I thought he was, but he came back.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Defense against what?
So what does this thing do?
A medical team will be standing by.
Not you?
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
I said pull over.
Yeah, kinda.
You need help.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
...to ride out and meet them.
A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
And you cannot love me...
Who?!
That I cannot.
People make you laugh?
To kill and be king, is that all?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Yes.
I see, your excellency.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Maybe the circuit is busy?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Of course I didn't.
May I ask...?
Please.
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Karl!!
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
I'm Father Karras.
Where?
Pretty close?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
It's not important good night.
No
What?
Your kidding?
You know how?
You think?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
So what's wrong with her?
Withering Heights.
In here. With us.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Oh really, when?
Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
And let my cry come unto thee.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Fuck him!!!
Just a minute.
Twelve.
I don't know.
It's my goddamn car!
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
You bring trunks, Jack?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
Am I late?
Jack...
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's not family.  It's business.
What?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
All right.  What's your name?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Okay?
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
So what do you think?
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Unless you want the right.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Christ, can't you hear it?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He was wearing a suit.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Nothing. We get nothing.
Seventy-one
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
You weren't there.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
No.
I'll take the Mallory.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Five years ago.  November.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
Spur of the moment.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Blanche.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Don't take it personally.
How should I take it?
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
When we know.
Where's my name?
Changed?
It's orange!
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
Save it for your wife.
Big feet.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Piece of cake.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Great?
Tell her.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Huh?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I'll call you.
Job.
Funny job.
Right.  Bring him back.
And you don't?
He'll come around.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Can't sleep?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
If I see him.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
No.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Married.
My days are not the old days, genius.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Sure.
Good to see you, Ma.
Eddie.
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
Is that what you think?
It's important.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
No.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Oh, that Karl.
-- Yes.
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
Why Jack?
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...
Who did?
I think I could figure it out.
Five thirty.  Okay.
I dont think so.
Its just two kids, right?
Pretty much.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Yes you do...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Get out!
Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
...my feet are hurtin...
Whatever you say...honey.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
If you want to look at it that way...
I want it...
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Paris?
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
And God love you for it.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which...
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Don't you wander off, boy.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
I already got it.  Everything I want.
About me?  How sweet.
Is it safe?
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
But all these people...
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Hilarious.
Ben's still out there --
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
And reverse the mutations --
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
I'd hold that off awhile.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
A long time, with one man.
And if it should take more time to get through --
A surgeon might...
What gives you that idea?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
It's too late now. We must go on.
Yes...
I've done all I could with the laser.
You left something out.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
What about Dr. Michaels?
How are you, Miss Peterson?
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I'm married.
That makes two of us.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Uh -- what?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Look at those Walls up ahead!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
The Wall's transparent...
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
What do you mean?
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
I don't know. Few munce.
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
No, that's not it, Jerry.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Well, okay, it's -
Oh, geez.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Oh, he's adorable.
Yah.
Ya got that right.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Ya got that right.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
Mm.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
You bet.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Yah, real good.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Yah.
...Is everything okay?
No kiddin'?
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
The heck d'ya mean?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
No way.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't mean to -
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'm sorry.
It's okay...
Oh. Geez.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
We've got a -
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon.
Oh, fine.
That's terrific.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
You are?!
You need to make these your primary "action items."
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Can't you give me something?
What?
I'll expose you.
Really?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...
Worth every penny.
Here.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Chloe's dead.
When?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What is wrong with you?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Don't ask.
Oh, yeah.
... You know me?
Is this part of the test?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
What do you want me to do?
How's that working out for you?
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Thank you.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
You get the idea.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
But a good strange.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
Hemingway.  You?
That was three times you promised.
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
It isn't... ?
We don't... ?
What are you doing?!
"Applicant?"
Answer me, Tyler.
The house is rented in your name.
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I'm going to...
If you know, I know.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
I think this is about where we came in.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
I swear on my life, I won't...
What have you left for me?
What?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
You told me you'd say that, too.
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Let go of me!!
They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
I... I don't know...
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
You were there?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
Take my van!
Maybe.  What's this about?
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
How do you know?
I know how it feels to be dead.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
I know who you are.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
What's that?
There's the Mekong.
You stopped.
There's a compass in the handle.
No cigarettes.
Pirates?  No kidding?
American?
You comin'?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Huntington Beach, California.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
I couldn't get you in.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Why me?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Colonel.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
I was attacked.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
He just needs some clothes?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
No.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No...  He is supposed to live there?
You can ask.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Hi... Where are my shoes?
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Parry!
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Who?
What?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You advise us!
What a gyp.
Well, it's enough for me.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
You're playing the other side.
You got another ball comin'.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Okay...
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Now don't...
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
No...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
With applesauce?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
Nothing.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I gave it a second thought.
I was really very moved by the way you...
Why?
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Is he?
Yes, it is!
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
Is she?
I don't think that's true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
If you want to call it that.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Oh, for pity's sake...
So get the fuck outta here.
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Alright.
Nothin'.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I can't man, I'm punished!
Pitt.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
A bad attitude.
Who?
Yo, that's my girl.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
You mean her.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
They didn't do anything.
Ask anybody.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
For sure?
You don't know me.
My pleasure.
What, the heat here?
You gonna nail the chief?
Nothing. They're still there.
Right. Fine.
I'm fine.
Oh my God!
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
That's it?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
What?
Oh, about ten days ago.
Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
What's that?
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
That's Brazil.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Please.
Alan's in Utah.
You are a rich woman.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Hi.
Here, take mine.
God...
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
I want to hear this.
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Tell the cops.
Irwin...
I don't know.  Look!
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
Well, there we're in a gray area.
You were going to can me, right?
I was upset.
Yeah.
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Please.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Who?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Why are all these people after me?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
People still watch that?
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
There's that question...
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
Forget it.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Did he just say what I think he said?
I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
You need it.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
Really?
Fine!
The case!
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Golly, I'd probably faint.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Everything is everything.
Who brings it?
No... yeah...
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
He is not wrong.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
S'right.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
Fake it.
Where from?
Yeh?  Who else?
I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
Not a chance.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Toy wit' this will ya.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
What are you saying?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
Do you know how much I love you?
Okay...
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
So am I.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Get him home safe.
Glad to hear that.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
29-years ago.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
It's Mom.
Whatta you mean...
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
What?
How'd you know my name, mister?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Nah, just working the job.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Same thing.
Cool it, Andy.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
A hammock?
Somebody was in here.
You're Shelly?
May be please have the wallet.
Gulp!
It was nothing.
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
You're wrong.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Daddy, what is going on?
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Uh...yes.  But...
Okay.  There's one.
No.
Why?
'Cause it stinks.
Wait a minute. I just...
I hope so.
Are they grown-ups?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Which is?
Will you listen, dammit!
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
So let's talk.
I'm here.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Not so bad, today.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
June the 19th.
Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
I'm now begging you.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
I'm literally going to kill you!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Improvise, of course.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Time to check out the waiters.
Rennie's not coming.
This is Jason's fault!
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I'm staying.
This isn't a request.
What about not-so-great writers?
I don't know what to say...
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Paisley Porter.
She was very evasive.
Let's work on it.
She died.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
She is kicking you out.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
It's only our first date.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
They're always winning. Until they lose.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
What am I doing?
It's a simple subject.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
This could be it!
They're my team.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
What about my play?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
You're not making sense.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yes, Peter.
What color?
Yes.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
A little drastic maybe?
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Would you like to meet him?
Is it true?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I don't want you, Steven.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
Stop!
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
"Hell!"
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
Hm.  Is it?
Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
No.
That's when you take advantage.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
The fools!  Sorry...
Very well.
I congratulate them.
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
He's right, Maria.  That's right.
No?  What's keeping you?
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Suit yourself.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
You may as well invite her here.
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
We were just looking.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
There's a problem, Lamar.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Stay clean.
Beynon.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
That's your problem.
Get it over with...
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Boring.
It's all right.
Better than I remembered.
I didn't. I just waited.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
That bad?
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
We keep going.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
When they find it, they find it.
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
Sure...
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Yeah... I guess it does.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
Two.
What do you have in mind?
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Not now.
That right?
You can trust him...
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Yeah.
Why?
Jack, you're wrong.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
I call that regular.
No.
Is he coming here?
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
Oh, what you doing now?
Why would it?
Nowt.
Who's Brumby?
Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
It never is.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
No.
Yes, thank you.
Not much.
It would be. If they were still living.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's all right, Eric.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Sod off.
Yep.
Nasty way to go.
Yes.
Ha.
Where am I going to work?
To get on the...
Well, I think I had one once.
They killed the goose.
And now...
...this shit...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
It's not right.
Eh...?
That's right?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What act?
Yes...?
That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
Hey.
Is that what I said?
He'd give me a job.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
No.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
You went for it.
Do you need five grand?
What?  You can't do any what?
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
We had a robbery. 
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Would you excuse us, please.
The people downtown said...
Would you come in here, please?
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Murray said...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
...they kicked out.
The leads are assigned randomly...
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
I have to go... 
Because I say so.
Get 'em to me!
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Yes, I am.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
What are you talking about?
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
That's right.
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Kenilworth...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Yes.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
I don't know.
She won't listen.
What power?
This.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You going to turn State's?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
The...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Do you like them?
Bought at the airport.
Connie.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
I'm not afraid of his words.
 You're a good fellow.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We were all upset about that.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
What is it?  Can I help?
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
We have time.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
I've always taken care of you.
Beautiful.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
I don't know.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
They can come in now.
I know he's in Israel.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Mike wants it.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
He is, I believe, a brother.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
I'm going to the market.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Sleeping inside me.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Why too late?
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Goodbye, Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Yes.
We do favors for each other...
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
The money was sent.
I do not.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
They feel cheated.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Good.
Some water.
No, she's here.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
What if I say shove it?
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
Fuck you.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
I'm not married.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
You're sure of that?
You did not know?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Splendid.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
What was wrong?
Huh?
You went to university?
Yes.  You were a Marine.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Can't today.
All righty.  I understand.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
I'm not, you know.
What happened?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
I want -- I want...
Do I look okay?
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
Never gave it much thought.
But you said --
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
Your friend?
It's too tight.
Did I hurt you?
All right.
Thank you.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Elsa?
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
She is beautiful.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Fish.
Point-five ...
Right there -
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Consider me gone, Detective --
Right ...
Got it ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
That's a good one, Donny...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
It ain't what you'd call a "good sign"
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
He's in some trouble ...
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Don't go there, Toby --
You, too
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
You can handle it?
You?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
What for -- ?
I gotta get my tool --
For real?
Call 'em here -- ?
On account of me.
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey -
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
Deodorant.
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
You're going high-cheese, dude --
How is he -- ?
Yeah ... You -- ?
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
She soars -
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You sure I can't go with ya?
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
Wha?  Me?
Anybody!  You understand?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Oh no! No!  Noooo!
I got seared.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
You're some fucking jerk.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Yeah, yeah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Okay?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
We'll pick it up.
That's important.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
Oh, Morgan!
Watch what happens.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Gone.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Yah, all right...
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes "Stay here" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, "Fuck it." He gets in his car and drives home.
Oh, Morgan.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
History.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Codebreaking.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Good to see you.
Why me?
Five.
Can we do it at my office?
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
I been here a couple years.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
--Gerry--
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
Sounds good.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
That's very presumptuous.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
No.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
You're kiddin' me.
What?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Okay...
Not far from here, South Boston.
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
How the hell did you do that?
I've never seen your place.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
All right, all right. We'll go.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Lots must a died, too.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Short fella. Pale face.
What's it to you?
Women?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
How many of you?
That's the way it is.
You got dances too?
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Crate fell on me.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Why, you're the preacher!
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
No, I never. What?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
I aim to.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
What you mean?
You been acrost?
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Yes, ma'am.
Take her with you!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
Okay. I be back a little later.
But will it--hurt the baby?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Don't taste bad.
That's right. And douse some in it.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Ya say we're acrost?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Since before they stopped us las' night.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
What's that--detour?
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Ain't no whisky, is they?
Casy, won't you say a few words?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
I wisht it was day.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I want to be an actor.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Bad experiences.
You met people.
That'd be good.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Yes.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
Say more.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
No harm no foul.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
It was the PLO.
Whatever.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
I love. I kill.
No...
And not show it to me. Ever again.
I'll pay.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
See you next week.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Yeah...
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
No.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Five years. My son was born here.
Son?
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Annie!
Okay.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I said... I started.
My period.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Did you speak to Farlow?
I should be in by two.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Okay.
Doing what?
Yeah.
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
When are you coming home?
Yeah, what?
I don't understa-
Tubab means white man.
Oh, I don't know...
What choice!!?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
You don't seem to upset?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
No thanks.
That's what some folks say.
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
She's an editor.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
What does that mean?
I want to watch.
So?
You shut up, stupid!
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Sometimes.
Honey... I was always good.
It's cool!
Again?  Yeah sure.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Yeah?
Roger.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
Razor and Blade.
How did you know that?
Burn!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
No, you're not in my class.
I'll give it a shot.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
You're not gonna win.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
I didn't know what was on it.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
I'm trying to help you.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Uhhhmm...
Good.
My name is the Plague.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Virus?
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Nonono, thank YOU!
I'll take you down there.
Don't get angry.
I don't know Brady.
No, you don't understand.
We're trapped in this house.
Can't you find somebody else?
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
We should call the fire department.
I can see this is useless.
Has he been prepped?
I don't want to.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Oh Rachel!
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
What?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
That's probably all he can do.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
I can't.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
Is that all you say?
Yeah, sure.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
They may be right.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Totally.
Is Annie around?
See you.
What about the bogyman?
There WAS.
I'm scared...
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
It means... I see.
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Mm-mm!
I can't believe it!
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
What?
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
Yeah?
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Hi.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No!  No...
Oh, I would love to hear it.
Did you ever read this one--?
What do you expect me to say?
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Why?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Oh, all the time.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
I didn't say that.
My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Always.
So?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Hmm?
They're in the basement.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
No.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Why?
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Y-yeah.
Like what?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
...you know?  I, uh...
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
What are you talking about?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Singing?
Well-well, like what?
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, so loosely.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
Yeah, it was.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Nobody ever said it.
You have.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Okay.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Oh...
Hmm.
Take our literature...
I'm going to tell you later....
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Why me?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
M'I gonna see you tonight?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
I know her by the Back.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
I've never heard that he...
No, no, of course not.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Why?
No. 
I am all attention.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...how so?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
...yes.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
...which of us is free...?
...what has she done to harm you...?
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
I know where he is.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Dottore Fanelli...
Brazilian. 
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...yes, yes, yes....
Then what brings you back?
Yes.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
No.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Say Hi for me.
Goodnight, Jasper.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
Hey--that coffee?  You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Talking while kissing.
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
What do you want me to say?
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Don't get cocky, girl.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Heather? Wha...
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
How very.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
Oh.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
Let's kick his ass.
I think so, man.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
What now?
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
stands and walks toward the door.
Fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
It doesn't matter.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
That . . .
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
I know what to do about mother.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Bull...
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Well?
Yeah, how's that?
Really? Do tell.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Ambrose. I know.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
What?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where's my wife?
No please make yourself at home.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
We're all here for you Trevor.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Ambulance.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
This game is over do you hear me?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
YOU!
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
Me!
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
Lie, you mean...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
Were you in it?  In the war?
You never saw that picture, huh?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Yes.
LaPlante!
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
What toys do you have?
Well, it's for a woman.
When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
I should.
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Aw, okay.
RUDOLF!
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
But it's what we want.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
What?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
No.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
Just reduced.
I didn't.
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
-- A man.
Even cosier.
They appear to be authentic.
So?
What?
You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Around.
No.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Maybe myself.
I'm sure they will.
France.
No -- I will.
No -- after you.
What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
How?
I cannot explain.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
I remember you.
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
Why?  What's going on?
Then who's Russell Nash?
You look like you have.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
No.
It will not end tonight.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
No.
What will you do?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I'll make the call.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Bullshit!
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
It's about Mars --
I'm not going to die for this!
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
It won't be a problem.
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I think you got no choice.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Stop it.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
I can't go without Thomas.
Yes.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Keep your head down.
He didn't say.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
What's wrong with the radio?
Stand by.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
What do you mean by that?
Of course.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
I don't understand.
I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
No, sir.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
You will tell them the truth.
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
How do you know?
I will give you my house.
He wants your wisdom.
Murdered! By whom?
Stay with the children.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
How can we help him.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
Go out! Where?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
What does it matter.
A Volkswagen.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yes.
It's not going to let us out!
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
And we get this money when?
Best of a nightmare.
Why?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
There's always exceptions.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
-- listen to the man --
We're safe?
It's succeeding!
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
All accidents until proven otherwise.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- and who's next on your list?
You didn't think to ask?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
I am.
Good way to get your head blown off.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
He must've beaten us all here!
What's going on?
Over here.
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
How's your arm?
Well then who did?!
Go to your room!  Now!
Take me to her.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
I just, I don't know...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
I don't know.  That's strange.
What about keeping an open mind?
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What are you talking about?
Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
Come back to us honey!
It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
What can we do?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Oh, Terri ...
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
It has already begun.
What do you want?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Guards come exactly every three minutes....
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
But I said I was sorry....
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Too-do-loo, babe.
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
A little petting is not the issue!
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
How long were you in?
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Wha.....
We're here to say, your government was right.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
The Hudswinger!
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
Sure, Norville, sure...
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
He grins wolfishly.
Terrific.
I got big ideas, though!
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
I thought you served misfits here!
Well, I --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
I --
You --
Wait a minute!
Hmmm.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
Fah from it...
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Yes.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
My brother's wife.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Wait. I want to listen.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
I hated her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
It's a starting place.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
We're not going anywhere.
I'm fine dad.
Nah.
Huh?
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
With Mikey?
It's not a bother.
I used to know how to cook.
It's not like we're too busy.
No need to make excuses --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Moisture! Moisture!
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Let's see!
Thanks for the advice dad.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Mikey was looking for you.
The ones you built?
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
That's all, for now.
I had him!
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
What happened at that signing?
Seven years.
What are we thinking?
You're not missing much.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
Thought you wanted something fun...
But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
I suppose.
I was a mentor to her.
Congratulations.
There's nothing more to talk about.
But we work so well together...
Then so was mine...
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Who made us what we are?
Then there is nothing.
And yet you knew what I would o.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
But you're the fairest by far.
It will grow back again!
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
Does it?
I took your life. He gave you another one.
The swamp...
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Yes...
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes, and very beautiful.
Be still!
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
So you felt it too!
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Call him.
I can't do it.
Yes...
The crucifix -
Forget the crucifix. Take him.
Do you think so?
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
You have it...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
What about coffins?
How could I not? She had to know.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What about a radio?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
But, he said he'd try.
No, I'm the King of the World.
Don't even think about it.
Some.
Just kidding.
Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
I've got to see.
Come on, you can make it.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
We gotta get out of here. Now.
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
How much?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
No. I shot him.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
So why are you still here?
Hey -- shut up, okay?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
Drunk again?
Well 
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Thank you.
I think not.
On my word! That's what they believe.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I don't know now without my father.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Her family name?
What is her illness?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Thea?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
All right  all right.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Where's Mary?
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Oh, wonderful!
George Bailey.
I know. I know.
Yes, sir.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
A cattle boat?
Uh-huh.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Hello, Violet.
Hello, Vi.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Hello?
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
I don't like coconuts.
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
You may kiss my hand.
How's that?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
To keep from being an old maid.
Where's your coat and hat?
George, darling! Where have you been?
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
With butter, if they got any....
No problem, no problem.
No.
Shut up.
That's awful.
Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
I need a hand here....
Not the drugstore!
What else is there to do?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Oh, c'mon.
Yeah?
Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
Is that what it is?
My ass!
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Probably.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Home it is.
Door's locked.
Damn.
Santos' place.
Nothing, huh?
No.
Terrific.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What'd I say?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
I know, I know....
What?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
Sure they did....
Now I really want to see it.
Shh.  Shhh....
I will, I will.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Next week.
With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
What about sailing?
Coming about....
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Not tonight.
Coming about, then.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I want to go with you!
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
He thought he had a good reason.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
I can get it.
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
Shit.
Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
Want another one?
I don't like what he does.
Hi, baby.
They just wanted to say hello.
I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
Yes?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Sean, that's right...
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
... Okay.
But you --
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Why are you?
I like it when they wake up.
And I like you.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
He's missing.
Better than catching Sean's herpes.
As always.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
What, hon?
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Five hundred yards.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Sharks???
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Yeah, right.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Yes, I did.
We need milk....
Tell Matt he should be here....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Turn it off....
I can't help it....
Henny Youngman....
Stop what?
I'm not doing anything.
You can stay in my room.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I'm just getting started....
You were a monkey....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
Good.  So will I....
I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
Good.
You look tired....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Where do I pull off...?
I'm terrific... Come on....
But it gets cold in winter....
That's hard to imagine....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Still tagging conch?
How's Ellen?
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Forget it....
So did I....
How long?
As long as he's been here....
Who?
Stop that!
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
It's my fault...I have to....
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Who grows more beautiful....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
You heard. Look for the knife.
A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
I already did. What's his problem?
Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
It's twenty of three.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
No.
Yes.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
Why?
Why does he want to kill me?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Two or three years ago.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Oh honey.  It's spun.
-- stop --
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
You think so?
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Yeah, thanks.
And I am...
Mission... statement...
You don't have to explain.
Oh hell yes.
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Ten seconds, Rod.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
You.
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
No tell me. _ 84.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
I think so.
What --
Well.  Good luck with that --
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Not a chance.
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Don't be silly.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
What'd I say?
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
He says it's a bad idea!
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
We have to help him.
That one time was just the bumper.
Who's that?
DAD!
I didn't know, there were two islands.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
It won't hold!
Not if it can't dig.
What?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Really?  What do you do there?
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Any weapons, radios?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
You're right.
No we're not.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
I want to see the nesting ground!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
You've broken its leg!
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
She's with Sarah!
It'll hold!
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
What's that?
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
'Bout thirty seconds.
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
How am I supposed to transport them?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Are you sure?
Oh my God.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
You can't hold it by yourself!
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
Why not?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
I doubt it.
You have no idea.
Why?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Machines hate you?
Kids get scared.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
There's gotta be something - -
Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
You're a beautiful big animal.
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Thanks, Steve.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
They don't bother me.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
What about that other guy?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Fuck you.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Insomnolesence...
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Yeah, what is it?
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
About ten minutes.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
-- Small.
I gave it to him yesterday.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
You're just doing your job.
... My ... social situation?
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I suspected that he -- well.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
... All right.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
You mean you've actually begun some?
... A piece of paper ...
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Orlac is an account?
It's not too bad working here.
And we're upset too.
Ludwig?
What's to become of us now?
Amerika!
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
Two... maybe three.
Coz of something I lost.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Guess!
Well I have to close up now.
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
What was better? I made better bait?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
-- OK --
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Try some other ways. 
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
I called Trina.
You could at least look at me!
They don't scare me any more.
OK.
Where, how?
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
That who?
What?
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
She told me.
Has she talked with you since prison?
No.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
Trask --
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Soon.  Very soon.
Yeah?
Uh huh...
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's okay...
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
You are not allergic of onions.
Yeah?
Are you...gonna go...away?
Yep.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Why does he decide?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Overruled.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
No questions.
Objection!
Eight, almost nine years.
And yet you fired him.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
How long was that?
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Ted, do you love him?
What?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
What?!?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Joanna said that?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Sure.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Can I do anything I want?
So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
Time to study.
Yes, but they say he did.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
We do not know.
Look here!
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
I am braver.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
You are unharmed?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Much too young.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
Thank you.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I don't know!
Hey!!
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
No thanks.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Calm down.
Well...
He looks like a giant tea bag.
He heeds a tourniquet.
Yeah.
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Else.
I want you to go there.
I <u>tapped</u> you.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Shitbutt?
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Get me out!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Starling -
No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Who's the subject?
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Are you finished?
He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Sometimes you do.
May I see your credentials?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
Five... so far.
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
Two months.
No.
Did he try to?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Early. Still dark.
But you could. You did.
Dr. Lecter -
You knew them.
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
When? How?
What?
I sent three men to Webb!
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
And what is that?
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
By your leave, sir.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Yes.
Their arms?
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Intelligence may not be the right word...
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Shit...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Still...you did the right thing.
He's not at his station.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
What's wrong with it?
All right...
It bit me!
What's your air reading?
I know that.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
The infirmary?...
It's had a meal.
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Well what?
And Tom took care of them.
You get the guns?
They were . . .
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Where did he get a hundred grand?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
What they like then?
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
I mean it's fucking empty.
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Get your fingers out of my soup!
That's going on optimism.
What about all the gear?
How the fuck should I know?
Who's "they"?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
You're dismissed.
Skinny?
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
So is Buddy on your short list?
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
I'm a colonel.
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
I have a B average.
He does.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Cliff--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
What's it doing on a rifle range?
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You know who it was they dug up?
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was crossin' the river--
He was a unique individual.
No.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
The Sheriff.
Well, you hire illegals--
If you spent a little more time training them--
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Yeah?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Time marches on.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
Yeah.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Two years.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Like your story is over.
Pilar--
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Another woman?
Payne.
Uh-huh.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
All right.  It was...
About?
It's him... it's him.
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
Did your husband know Quaid?
We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
Harry.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I don't know where you'd start.
Some or it.
I wasn't.
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Yes.
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
...yes?
... they believe you.
I just saw him.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
No.  Not yet...
So could you walk on water?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
A ticket home,
I won't say anything.
What's her problem?
What?
Harry D'Amour.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
How the fuck do you do that?
Or murdered, like Nix.
I don't know what else to do.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Jesus!
Maybe... I... don't...
Who's not?
Is he the Puritan?
And he's dead?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
No!
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You'll do it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Ok.
No.
Oh.
Yeah? But look at you.
But, I'm mean.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
No, we'll find something around here.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Good-night.
Hi, Lydia.
What are you talking about?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
That's ok.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I got some hair stuff.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
I found them in your file box.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
You heard voices, you know you did.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You ready?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
Just open the door, please.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Well I know he's come here before.
Peter Kelson?
Yes... and you are?
What's that got to do with you?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
What?!?!
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
What?
That's true.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
The police used him as a witness in this case.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Don't curse.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I don't remember that.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Shh.  It's okay.
Why are you up?  Get in bed.
What?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Mom's going to hate it.
Yeah, right.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
Five seconds.
So?
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
You having fun?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
You had four offensive rebounds.
Fine, Quincy.
I said fine.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Then prove her wrong.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Quincy...
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
You want to go talk?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least you got your priorities straight.
I don't think so.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Business folks.
Keep your voice down.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Quincy, please...
Didn't we already have this conversation?
What mess?
And some things should never fucking happen!
I ain't a damn liar.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Does this sound weird?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
LAPD. Open the door.
I'm coming!
No one else in there with you?
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Great, bye.
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
Yes I do.
You mind if I come in, check things?
Yes.
-- can I get you?
They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
Sure, why?
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
What's up?
Well --
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Picky, picky.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
Gently, son --
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
He has Phil right now.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
...ah...
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Jack.
Is Jack your son?
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
No.
Muffy -- coffee?
Yes.
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
I'm sorry.
Right.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
It's interesting.
yeah.
I don't think, he can't...
You're just come in --
I don't have to answer your questions.
No one else in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
What's this, how did this happen?
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Been drinkin' today?
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
...you know...
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
Are you alright?
I'm sorry, Stanley.
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
-- did she talk to you?
I love you.
Do you have any children with anyone?
I love you so much.
Yes.  What's your name?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Saucy-saucy.
Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Linda --
Shut the fuck up.
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Shut up -- shut up --
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I need this one.
I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
You coulda been in front --
This happens....this is something that happens.
And you were not hurt?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
That doesn't matter now.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
What use am I?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Your mother's.
How did you --
A personal nature?
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
You would do that, your Majesty?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Cooperate?
So what?
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
I didn't hit shit!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Who is it?
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Where up north?
Figure you would have tried it already.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Yeah...
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Are you a regular there?
Ditched you?
Screw him!
No.  It wasn't like that!
I don't recommend it.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
You look all right now.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
See? You do know something about him.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
Get me a plane...
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
That's narrow?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
He went to the men's room.
For Christ's sake get him!
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Francis? Where are you?
Was I in an accident?
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He only bit women so far, right?
What about the dog?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Blue is cold.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
Yes. Is Molly there?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Yes.
We don't know that.
How did it happen?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
...after a while.
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Pray tell.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
No.  Caspiar.
I refuse.
Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
What's up?
That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hi... am I late?
I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
I used to think you were original.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Bob.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
He'll be contacting us again.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
Hurry!
Should Tank I.D. it?
No!
He's going to pop!
Midnight watch.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
What happened to them?
I got you.
Goddamnit!
What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
He's beginning to believe.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
It's an honor.
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Of the Resistance.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
We're on our way --
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
We can't leave him!
I'm coming with you.
Yeah?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
It wasn't fast enough.
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
You got sparklers?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
'And with your spirit.'
How do you know?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Thanks for the ride.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Wouldn't bother me.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Come on.
Ok, how's everything going?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
You getting out too?
How much was the original loan again?
Whatever.
Fine.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
What do they expect you to say?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Do you have enough?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
But...
Yeah...just had it delivered...
I know...I know.
Quiet please.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Oh, the goddam party --
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Red or white?
I thought you were buying my company.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Yes.
What'd it say?
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Yes.
Is there any more to it?
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
I don't think so.  Do you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Neat.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
That's what he said.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Don' need you okayin'.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Hi, Jennifer.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Are you?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
I'm sorry.
I haven't.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Very well, I'll watch.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Yes.  I'm tired.
I said get out.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
Then don't.
-- Yes?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
A 'deal'?
There's one to every rule.
I'm not everybody.
Oh.  Okay.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
That's okay.
'Fish'?
Then I can't help you.
Yes?
Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
I don't expect you to.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Thank you.
Then don't.
I don't!
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
I think you know --
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
Yeah.  Or the week after.
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
So what's wrong with that?
That's all?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Joe?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
The fireworks are about to start.
I'm sorry --
So you're a one-girl guy?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I would.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
I think I know her.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Hi, Leonard.
Then why is this my handwriting?
When was I in here?
You did.
Interested in buying one?
Don't say anything else.
Strip!
I don't want your fucking money!
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
I wasn't helping you for money.
You know what we have in common?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Dying.
How do you know about me?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Are you Teddy?
I don't know.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
Why?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
I don't know.
Shut it, Teddy.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Teddy. Your buddy.
From who?
What sort of questions?
How do you know him?
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
That, and your thing.						   *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
You won't remember!
Doing...?
Turn around.
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Where's the new drop point...?
It's a rip and a hit.
Tell them what you want.
I got to talk to my ADO...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
I got the item.
25% discount on the load.
It goes very fast.
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Havana.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Where's she now?
Later!  Do you dance?
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Where would I go?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Five minutes...
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Good.  So let's go...
On my way back...
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
And Jos, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Lotta rich women back there...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
I show you what problem --
For what?
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Oh hell, forget it.
Forget it.
Whatsa matter now?
What's that supposed to mean?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
You like it? Take a look.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
What of?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Ziat!
Billy?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty?
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
How long?
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
What?  You gotta be joking.
After we're outside the kogus?
It's already been cut.
What?
His radio Back of his open, radio...
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Mr. Yesil.
Who got the Frenchman out?
Yeah...?
Weird shit...?
New York's finest.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
Jump in.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
What are they...?
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I'm getting to believe you.
Well, I hope you like it.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
--cliff-hangers--
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
...have to wait.
Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
It is.
Don't talk to me like that.
What things?
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
So do I...
Newspapers?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
Then don't say it.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Lovely.
And you're happy about that?
What was the top bid?
In any case we don't want your cash.
- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
- this is very disconerting..
- right..
Indeed.
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Of what?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Something like that.
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
No.
No...
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
'Terrorists?'
Very.
Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Why not?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Do I?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
But why tell us?
All ten million.
Oh yeah?
There was nobody on the bridge.
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
You're sure about this?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I just need you to be safe.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Theyre dead.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Yes.
No sir.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
About what?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Like Job?
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
What was your deal with Job?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Give me a break, Pops.
Higher.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Sure.  If the main character does.
No.  Abort.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.
I usually am.
Dont flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
And I'll have the special fish.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
What?
I'm going to bed now.
And go to confession.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You haven't said anything.
What's your news?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
In a month.
Let's go tell your Mother.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
I have no life.
Maybe I should come back another time.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
He knew my husband who died.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
A bride without a head!
To the bed.
You don't get along with anybody!
You ruined my life.
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.
Thank you.
He didn't come!
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
You? No.
I don't understand.
Yeah.
He's my younger brother.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Pop.
Where's pop?
WHAT!! She was dying!
It was a miracle.
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Did you see it?
No.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
What sins have you to confess?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Talk to him.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
I don't know.
You don't know where Loretta is?
But absolutely!
Absolutely!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Look.
I don't know.
Yes!
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
Please!
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
What?
NI!
Oh!
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
No, no ... not "is"!
I move for no man.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well, what are you then?
Ni!
No.  No.  No!
I am an enchanter.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Quite.
Be quiet!
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
When's your next round?
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Farewell, Concorde!
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
What?
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
Camelot ...
Ector.
We must examine you.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
I didn't.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
You know what I mean.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
It's a diary.
Kitchen and lower house.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
A situation?
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Out of my way!
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
We --
Who'll bring it to me?
I beg your pardon?
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Do you hunt?
This is the top.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Maybe, once.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
No other aspiration?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
She'll never understand it.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes?
Yes.  Yes it was.
Not too protracted, I hope.
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Read it!
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
What the hell does that mean?
Hey, kid.
It's twelve-thirty!
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
What?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Then where do we go?!
You didn't hear me?
Don't even say it.
There...
Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Is that your question?
You have no time.
But I don't understand...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
Give her a chance, will you?
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Howdy to you.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
So, what did they say?
I can hardly wait, Coco.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
What?
Can you tell me what happened?
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
Mulholland Drive?
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Good luck!
Do you know them?!
No... but...
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Oh boy.
Could be unrelated.
Oh yeah.
Find out who they are?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
No...
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
We have to climb up that.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
How long till the room fills ?
Fine...
That was eleven years ago.
Hey , Hey !
A dragon.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Where ?
Got it.
When you are ready.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
I just want to double check the facts.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
I think I'll see hat action.
Thank you.
I meant him.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Good morning.
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
What do you remember about her.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Thanks, I needed that.
Totally groovy huh?
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Give my love to Shelly.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.

I told you it was a long story.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Do you have any pictures if her?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
It's just a corpse.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Then I have come to the right place.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I think it's cool.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Just give it to me!!
DON'T!!!
Leave me alone!!
And you'd be my cousin?
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Not exactly.
She'll be all right baby.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Is there milk in them already?
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
All right, here.
Keep your voice down!
Yes.
Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
It's there.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
They're dead?
What do you mean??
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
It's no big deal.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
Yes.
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Dad?
Any more soda left?
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
I love this guy! 
Dad??
Why?
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
No, no.
Oh, Vada...
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No.
Why do you think she says that?
Oh.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
What are they about?
Mostly love, and romance.
Okay.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Liverpool?
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
I'm trying.
It's a mosquito bite.
Where's your bike?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
What do you think it's like?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Hurry!!!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
I wanna live with them too.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Then go home, baby.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Something like that.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Kindred spirits.
He's still in love with you.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
When I'm talking to children.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
Can you watch the road?
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Exactly.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
Don't you see...
... unless he has a hump.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Such as.
My very point.  Here's another one...
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
Never can tell.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
It's more than that.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
It means a lot.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
It's two weeks.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
I know that, Star.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
You're so good.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What did you say your name was?
She's going to rest now.
You bet.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
He has that sign with the tree.
Okay.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
President.
How much?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
What crook?
Let me know when you do, all right?
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
She sure sings nice.
A little. What do you need?
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Oh... Well.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Hi.
Who is this?  It's Tom.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I can't.
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
Oh.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Yes.
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
Money's no object.
An album.
Sleeping.
Mary?
Depends on what I'm studying.
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
He is to a lot of people.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Where are you from?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
It's not bad.
You think I should take lessons?
You think it will?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
May I see your costume?
I see.
Yes, they were.
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
She was born without a tongue.
Yes.
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
Do you miss Mallory?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Describe Mallory.
When have they ever been right?
Sure.
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Yes.
No. Not really.
NO!!!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
I do, too.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
Only on a much grander scale.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
The entire wing?
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Perfecto!
Why?
How so?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
But you'll never be whole again.
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Two guys?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Want me to come?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Anderson.
I don't know.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
What d'you expect?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
No.
Don't Duff--
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
'Been up north?
I didn't know you had one.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Yeah?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Huh?
Yeah.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Yeah!
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
I bet she's easy jam.
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
I'm Duff.
She'll do.
That's right.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Who is?!
All right, son.
Thank you.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
I know.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Like hell you ain't!
Right here.
I'm fine.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
No. I only needed the code from you.
What about her?
Why not?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
What?
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
It's Case. Remember me?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Nobody has.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
How's the ice?
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
No!... No...
Where did you here that?
And Linda...
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Maybe something's onto him.
What's that supposed to mean?
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
On a good run... yeah.
Yeah.
They'll cut you down.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
What is it?
Nice.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
YOU KNIT?
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Who told!
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Anita!
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
You need my help?
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
A flack jacket.
A--flack jacket.
They hid my car--
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
I'm Rob's prom date.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Better than I...
And a gymnast!
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Really?
I-
Sure, why?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
I just can't look at you the same way.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
We're very evolved.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Lock.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Just what?
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Why not?
Specifically.
Who's Lisa?
No.  Upstairs.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
You two got a thing going, or what?
Naw. Just killing time.
Yeah, why?
No shit.
Shut up, Grady.
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
I'm not hungry.
Why won't you talk to me?
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
I can't!
Huh?
Making friends?
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Thanks, Mom.
I'm serious.
First door up the stairs.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Mom?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Don't hold your breath.
Research.
Jennifer --
Deal.  Thanks.
No, she's right.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
To old friends.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
I don't do that shit.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
A little basic, but nice.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Anything?
Didn't get much sleep.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
With Hypnocyl?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
Who would know where they were hidden?
No...
Your dreams?
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
Hi.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
And what happens next in the dream?
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
She left me.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
A bath would be great.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Okay.
Who was Gilda?
Oh.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
And what would you say...
I haven't decided.
What's your name?
Rufus.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
He's cooking guinea fowl?
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Where's Bella?
Da Vinci?
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Do you ever masturbate?
I believe I have.
May I help you, sir?
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Does she know you're coming?
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Hi...
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
And she's in your house.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Oh sure.  Of course.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
Sorry, ma'am.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
What for?
Right!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Thank you, ma'am.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Thank you, ma'am...
B-B-Billy.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
M-M-M-Mack?
Yeah...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Yeah, Mack?
Where ya goin', Mac?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
You heard me the first time!
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
No!
Can you borrow me a dime?
What's this?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Are you a doctor?
Ten bucks.
Sure...
That right?
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
You're sure...
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Hm.
Who's this?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
To the foot doctor.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
What?
Where's Positano?
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Yeah.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Sure is.
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I know...  It was.
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
Are you sure?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Why?
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
I'd love to.
I thank you.
Giovanni.
You said it differently then.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Good strategy.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Sure we keep records!
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
Why should he forget it?
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Mmhmmm.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
Tommy, what happened?
Give it to me my Pop's job
None of your business.
They play pretty rough.
I better get home.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
Do you like pigeons?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
You haven't finished your beer.
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
For not being any help?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
He wanted to see me again.
Pop!
I don't want to hear it in there.
Your gun.
Give me that gun.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
D 'n D?
Down to the wire?
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
Yeah, really!
Sure... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Hit me again.
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
Thanks, Johnny... .
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Maybe I will one of these days.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Maybe so.
Of course I do.
A symbol, Master.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Without the snake, of course.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
I know a Glenn.
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
You better come see this.
I'm a tourist.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
What?
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
You talked to him?
What'd you talk about?
You have to know what you're talking about.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Sure, Daniel.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Call and tell you.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Who?
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Wait, I know him --okay?
Yeah.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Glenn didn't tell you?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
If I could have a little more room.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
How many was that?
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Bleeding on a country road.
Think I could have them back?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
You won't do that.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Love it.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
I don't think we should get into that.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You know what I mean.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
I hear six.
When?
I know what you're talking about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
It's a big house.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
You goin' right back to work?
Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
For a time.
Meaning time came, I left.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
That time?
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You a lawyer?
It's a --
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He's still married though, huh?
He's about to.
You used to like it.
I'd like that.
No, he looks a lot...
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
It's possible.  Why?
That's right, just me.
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Ten gees.
Are they dead?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
He did.
Land of the free...
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Come on!
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Home of the Brave.
Yes you can.
Yeah.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
You were more like brothers.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Hang on.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Y-Yes Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Our doctor's gone too.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Learn English, then!
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Save it.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
What about Janet?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
Coffee and a donut.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
For everyone.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
At my age? Don't be silly.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Open it.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Oh no!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
For what?
I'm just happy to see you.
You have an incredible memory.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Come on. You can't be serious.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
How'd you know that?
What do they do up there?
It sucked.
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
You'll never find it in the dark.
Bob...
Sorry...
Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
A reaction to AZT...
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Maybe you should think about it.
Whatever.
Don't do this, Andy.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Funny.
Kids are great.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Continue.
Let's find you a drink.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I know a good probate lawyer.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Except... you were gay?
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
You're in trouble.
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Who?
Okay, Joe...
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
That's perfectly clear.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Charles...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Show me your eyes.
Look deeper.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
You sure you can keep --
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
Tell me it's not a mirage.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
You mean that "load" of passengers?
70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
Frightening thought.
There is no "safe."
You <u>don't</u> see.
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
What if you're one of five?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
What do you care?
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Do you have any weapons?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Well, maybe they're not.
Any particular reason?
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
The Hunt Club.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
What is this?
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Do you believe him?
This is his assertion.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Shaddup bitch.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Don you worry Bunny, youse a killer anyway.
'Lias come naturally.
And you, do you believe?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Right...
I really don't know.
You don't know.
Okay. You win.
How do you do?
Just drunk enough.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
As I said before...
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I didn't say anything.
I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Absolutely sure.
Us?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Would I want to?
Right, Miss.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
Is it a crime?
I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
Because you think your in love with me?
Why not here?
Sometimes.
A private joke.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Would that make me a heel?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I don't think you locked your door.
Convenient, isn't it?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Would you?
Go live in a tent.
What do I get for it?
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
Open it and count it.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
Now, you're being beastly.
So far.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
Who's the girl?
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
It's kind of you to see me.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Yes.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Hello.
I'll have some of that.
No.  I'd want to--
Good.
No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
I have to be up early. 
I haven't really thought about it.
I might.
Might?
You approve!
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Okay, I will.
Oh, I see.
All right.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
She said that?
They won't let you in without one.
No.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
You gotta earn trust.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
I take the skin off chicken.
Not so far.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Got it.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
You sure?!
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Something... in the trees...
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Right behind you.
I'll take him.
Thank you, Sergeant.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Where the hell is his body?
There's no sign of it.
He knows our defenses.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Please, we hardly know each other.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Sit... and spin.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Diet coke.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
"Occupational hazard".
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Was someone rude to you?
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Where are you taking me!?
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
But, Edward...
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
You bullshittin' me?
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
What if they serve soup?
They will serve salad.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
It's very expensive.
I swear it will be done.
You're a silly girl.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
And a good thing too.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
I thought I was going faster.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
But you don't know where he is.
Over the Albino, I think.
What?
Try ruling the world sometime.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I swear it will be done.
Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Thank you.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
You're that smart?
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
I will. And I choose --
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
An hour.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"Of the silvery moon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Ooooooops.
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Yes, it's quite possible.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
What???
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Right.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
You found a flop!
A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Liebkind, no!
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
No kidding?
Good.  I will make the preparations.
I don't know.  I don't know.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Here I come, ready or not.
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Of Siegfried...
Heil you know who!
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
I mean in show business.
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
And when she left, she never came back.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
Just what he told your detective.
Lila.
Huh?
No.
Maybe we can handle it together. 
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Why can't I go out there with you?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Yes. I think he would have.
Who's he?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
We could laze around here a while longer.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
You have a vacancy?
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
The bathroom.
I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
Norman Bates.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
I imagine so.
She sounded strong...
Why don't you go away?
Norman.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
Now what?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Norman took a wife?
Satisfied with your cabin?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
What--special autopsy?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
I don't know--I can't tell--
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
He isn't here.
Yes, the child ...
I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
You would.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Thank you.
What do you think I am?
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
And they never proved anything against him.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
I see. Was that all she said?
That is unfortunate.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
But I have some friends waiting.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
You did miss --
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
How?
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Dysfunctional --
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
But Rose...
I said I wouldn't.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
I do, too!
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I don't know.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
What did you say, Brother?
She's getting herself up to go out.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Here comes Daddy.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Quarter of twelve.
Is she all right?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
He's a polecat, dear.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
The hell we can't.
I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Mine.
Your baby?
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
She looks terrible, just awful.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
You're so sweet.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Be quiet, Rose.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I was going to tell him.
Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
That wasn't my fault.
We'll share.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
I got him.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
Birth control's important.
Follow me.
Then, why'd we tie him up?
No.
Bummer.
Where have you been?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Let's hope.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
That's not true.
All for one...
Out here.  On your knees.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Do tell.
It's one of a kind.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
His lightsaber.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Wouldn't miss it.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Yeah, sure.
Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Lower it!
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
We shall double our efforts.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
So, you have accepted the truth.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
So please don't tell me to can it.
Uh huh.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Weiss.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
Oh don't be so shy.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
I didn't make him for you
Was all I had to say
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Shell-shocked!
...Goodnight, Rocky.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
By accident?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Do you have a phone?
D'you really wanna call?
Why?
What?
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Apollo?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
You didn't!
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
What?!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
...Thanks.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Where're you off to now?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Don't like yours neither.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Few minutes?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
You have my food in ya hand.
Ya sure?
I feel bad about walkin'.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Makes your breath like garbage.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
...What?
Yeah.
More like thirty.
The legs must be goin'.
How do you mean?
Freak luck for sure.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Ya got heart.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
It don't matter.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
I got whiskey here.
The story -- what's happenin'?
Sure I like her.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
R.K. Maroon.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
So what do you want me to do?
That was the idea.
No, I don't.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Get away from there.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Forget it.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
The what?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Where is my Lady's lord?
Goodnight.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
You kiss by the book.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
I don't know.
From Interpol?
Is that right?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I'm a patriate.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
You'll die if you leave here.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Then I guess we're set.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
I didn't expect that he would.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Not for long.
Eat shit and die slowly...
I didn't know that you spoke French.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
Know what?
Gregor's cell phone...
A lot of people died.
You don't have to do this.
Clearly.
Do what?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
How could you have done that?
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
Business keeps you on the road?
Something like that.
In a minute.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
I guess that's for the best.
You put everything on the line because you...
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
The Russian would be easier.
I want to get some hounds down here.
We don't know that.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
I don't know.
He saw everything!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I don't know...
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
There it is...now what about the others?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
And you're solid on that?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
What for?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
No.  But he would, probably.
I love you too.
That son of a bitch.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Great...
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
You know I do.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
This just might be our ticket!
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Anything...specific?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Sort of.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Hi.
Well I don't know --
So...what's the good news?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Bathroom.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Ask me if I give a shit.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
You pull a muscle or something?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
Gimme the binoculars.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
Shhh, my head hurts.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Now that I believe.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
MMMMMM!!!!
It's worth it to me.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
New York City?
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
I need your help.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Why don't you go get them?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Now you know.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
The Secret Service?  Why?
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Yes, Master.
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
Shut up!
Sir, I can explain.
I know, but --
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
I was being polite.
Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
The art.
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Yeah. So why you look do down?
That's what you were supposed to be!
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Shut up!
You a cop or something?
I still have work to do here.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Of course.
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Oh, I will.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
You know, your daughter seems...
Excellent.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Six-fifty.
Cindy the manicurist.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
Brian told you that?
I'd rather not.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I'm listening.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
But I'm weird.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
A harmless joke.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
So you're angry.  Big deal.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Okay, okay.
What?
About forever.
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
It was my mother's.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Look!
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What's with you?
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
What?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
What?
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
No, I'm not. 
A sense of humor.
I know.
I want my money.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
Any time.
It's a sign.
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Who is this?
It's been about a year and a half.
What's she talking about?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
What is it?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Do you want a fruit plate?
I don't think I have to now.
Right.
What?!
P.  Dad?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Everyone at work heard you.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Sure.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
I think they're announcing your flight.
You must be Jonah.
I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
How's it going?
You want 'em all arrested?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Aaah, what's the use?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
But it's yours. I won't let them ...
No.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Yes.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Like what?
What are you saying?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Not even a guess?
Who wouldn't?
Why not?
You get off on abuse or something?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
It's the only way to play.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
It's me.
I can't tell you.
They would have killed you too.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Why?
Danny, it's not what you think.
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Guess it's our turn.
Palmdale
Yes, Jimmy.
Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
Good for you Jimmy.
Understand what?
Pull your pants down.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
No last name?
Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
I was trying to score some dope.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Jesus.
It speaks!
The Mexicali Boys
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
There's no motels around here.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Just admit you're wrong.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
I thought you were done.
Resistance?
Not where I come from.
They got squirrels there, too, right?
I guess.
Pass.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
Did he see any sign of them?
I changed my mind.
Beasley's dead.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
It doesn't take this.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Vecchio.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
See to it.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
And Sarge?
Captain, he's fast!
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
That's right.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
C'mon Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Come on, it's graduation.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Meaning?
Look at his face, he did the deed.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
I can accept that.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I just had a phone call.
Now why can't I tell the story?
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Honey, it's not what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
You think you know what this money is?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
What?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Okay.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.  With potential.
Friends with potential.
Yeah?
This is so noble.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
How can I look at you and say this?
No, no.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
What do you want?
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
I know.
Your car?
We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
I called her up.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I was just going to kind of move around.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Oskar, please -
War.
It's bad business.
Yeah, what's that?
He's important to my business.
These people, my people, I want my people.
It's good business.
You're not telling me something.
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
Of course I'm on it.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
How do you do?
I need a drink.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
I think most people right now have other priorities.
The war could end.
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
You did so much.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Why aren't you there?
Fair enough.
No, I don't.
Youre all in this together?
She dumped me.
Yeah.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
Good question. You took the bait.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
What guy?
He hates Oliver Stone.
So we found a compromise.
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Meaning?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
No, wait here.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
But who would operate your camera?
What?
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
Yeah, right.
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
But...
Where you going?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Excuse me?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Sid I can see you!
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
You used to say that was our strength.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Who is it?
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Sure.
I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
None.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
What are you talking about?
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
No, it's not.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
You rode your bike out there?
What are you doing here?
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
I called my dad.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Gotta go.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Come on. It'll be fun.
...please...
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Deputy... good evening.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Afraid not.
We haven't located her Dad yet.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
I told you to send it back.
Casey? Casey?
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello Sidney.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Don't shoot. It's me.
It would certainly improve your high school Q.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
The official term is "psychotic".
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
What happened?
They think it's school-related?
How do you gut someone?
Just like old times, ain't it?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
Come on, let's rock.
Oh, god...
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Thank you.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Good.
You know.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Okay...
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
And, why is that?
Sit back.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
No one yet.
Guessing at this point is useless.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Oh, that's all.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
And?
He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
Who pays the rent on time.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Him?
For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
We need a warrant.
We had him.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
Where's the victory?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
That part of me is dead.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Are you absolutely certain?
What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
Huh...? No...no water.
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
I'm Clayton.
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
JOINT action?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
That don't make 'em kin...
Oh...
He just couldn't wait...
Think she means for us to follow?
Nine...  Ten!
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
We won't be here...Come on!
Not no more.
It's what I'm countin' on.
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Maybe an animal.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Never!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
See you in jail.
What is the chief part?
Romeo
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Interesting.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Put his feet in.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
How will it?
The show must  you know
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I thought your play was for Burbage.
I will.
Be still.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I like her.
Oh, not for the world!
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Oh--no, no!
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
and thus unable to declare her love
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My hat?
If you love her, you must do what she asks.
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
She sings too?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
You're a bad loser.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You think so?
And what about you?
So who's going to do it?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Just stop worrying.
How much?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Where do you think you'll go?
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
What?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
And you like it?
Yes.
Cameron?
Really?
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Hugo.
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
That's not him.
No.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
What are you doing here?
Oh.
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Let him go. Let him take it all.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Two hundred pounds?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
I should hope so.
And you need your sleep.
It wasn't like that.
In this firm.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Yes, sir.
The human condition.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Look again if you like.
Same as everyone else.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Diseases.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Don't you like her?
You mean that girl, don't you?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
What?
I don't know.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
No, I know.
Hello, George.
Let it ring.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
I asked you first.
Making it with my mother?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Then what do you think?
That you're just like your mother.
How is she?
She is.
Pardon me?
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Great... so how's everything with you?
Yeah, I think so...
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?
Yeah?
You were great.
He never stopped.
We're friends.
-- oh I thought you were --
Me?
Look about last night --
Don't go, Jackie...
Wash her.
What with?
-- Oh my yes.
-- Otis?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
Okay... thanks...
Fine. How are you?
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Yeah, baby.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
About what?
When I get off work.
When is that, George?
... Okay...
Well that's something.
I'd like you to leave now.
Did you?
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
Thank you.
I see.
I know it, I know it.
Well... who are those guys?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Did they have something against me?
Didn't they tell you?
Me!
No --
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
No.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Okay.
And?
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Who do you think I was talking to?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Of course not.
Fine.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
See you later.
I know, I'm sorry.
It's been so long I don't how long?
I would say so, yes.
-- uhh-huhh...
Johnny!
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
I don't think so.
Of course not.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
Jill.
-- just wonderful.
John...
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Red Rum.
No.
Thank you.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
A nigger cook.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Sure.
I did?
Sound good to you, Danny?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Yeah.
It's about eleven thirty.
No, nothing at all.
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Wendy!
Stay away from me.
Stop swinging the bat.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
You're a real booger, you know it?
For getting a divorce?
No.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
What?
Good.
Yeah... sure.
Save this one for last.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
What you say?
I think I hear it!
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
Yes?
Oh my! 
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Just about.  Show me again.
You betcha.
Am I?
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Three years.  A rookie.
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Right.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
They're from my old convent.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Deal.
Would you like that?
A what?
No food?
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
What?
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
But...
Good day.
I'm a Christian.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Hail, Mary.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Really.
They open a window.
Who are you guys?
Yeah...
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Measles.
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
Find 'em!
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
They need guidance.
Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Well... that might be... helpful.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Chosen me?
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
What kind of nuts?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
We should go.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Other people?
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
And, what did he say?
We have no choice.
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Sit.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
Yeah, me too.
All right then.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Give me the big'uns.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Catch you later Freddy!
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
He does make some funny noises.
Please Doyle, don't.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
But maybe just for awhile --
Yeah.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
I reckon.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
He ain't ever okay to me.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Yes sir.
I'll be.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Ma'am?
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
Yeah.
No thank you.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Will he be supervised?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
An invitation?
And what are you, his chaperone?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
What about for you?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
But they're all the same.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Ah-hah.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
She probably died.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
And you're giving it to me?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
So I can get my job back.
What difference does it make?
And how much are these?
And these?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
And his parents?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
The what?
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Is your father an artist?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty.
How long have you been here?
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
It's all right. I really do know them.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Carl Heine's type.
No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
It seems human.  To me.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
Pretty darn clear.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Well, why does it?
The knife.  What knife?
I was checking the cables.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Maybe.
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
No spare.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
I already said that, b...
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
For the third time, yes.
Carl never lied.
He had no reason to.
That's all he said.
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
Fresh!
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
Shave our legs, stupid.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
Polish?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Good night, Josephine.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
Have I got things to tell you!
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Oh.
What engagement present?
Shut up and keep packing.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
I may throw up.
See you around, girls.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
No, no.
What did you say?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
When?
Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
I guess she's not in here.
What for?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Why not?
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
Yes, we're the new girls.
Oh.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Me?
Bingo?
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Why not?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
What makes you so sure?
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
I beg your pardon?
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Shells?  Whatever for?
It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
It's the thought that counts.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
It's all right for a bachelor.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Go where?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Pub Golf?
What? Why? What do you mean?
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Why, with you.
Sir, yes, sir!
Mom, please.
Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Oh, hello.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Both.
A weekend?
Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
I have a friend at the magazine.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Oh, cut the crap!
So, whyd you say yes to me?
You have more than one gynecologist?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
Will do.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
But where is my daddy!?
And so you did your job, right?
Can you swim?
Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
It was too dark, Daddy.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
What happened afta that?
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David!
Yes, ma'am...?
Same as we -- they pray.
David, come back here!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Good night, Mama...
I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Might be...
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Mornin'...
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I wanta see Nathan.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
My head hurts.
Fragile?
Chef, do you know anything about women?
Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!
What the hell are you guys doing here?
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
Huh?
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
MPH RM!!!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
Aw, ma!!
Do as I say, Kyle!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
FREEZE!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Our moms suck!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Wow!
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
What about air strikes?
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
I'm needing lunch.
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well shut it off at once!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
10-4 good buddy.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Words to live by.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
You too.
Hopefully sooner than later.
Marry you?
That's right.  Will you marry me?
Where's Taylor?
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
One moment please...  one moment please...
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
You have orange whips?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
La da da dalala...
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
No kiddin'.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
100 years! 
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
I couldn't care less.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I never saw you.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
You shouldn't touch her.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
SHEILA!
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Bowling "Center"!
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
He's no father to you.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
What do you want with my dad?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Not while I'm in training.
Well, that was plan A.
Nothing.
Plan C...  ...is me.
So why do you stay?
Nope, I couldn't care less.
Why should I help that old fuck.
Too late for what, Sheila?
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Tell me what happened Theo.
You should.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I am a professional man.
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Fletcher!  Now!
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
But she's --
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What if it attacks?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
What's wrong with oxygen?
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
But sir --
When was this?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Harry?  Can you copy?
Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
In the ship, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
You don't know that.
Please watch your closest monitor...
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
What sub?
Underwater?
What -- are you threatening me?
Yeah, it was awful.
What about you?  What happened to you?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You bastard.
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
I have to reset the sub.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
But I don't know how --
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
Still clear.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
The refridgerator.
None of this was here before.
What?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
It's a soporific.
For what?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
Are you?
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
But --
I never went in that sphere.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Yes you are...
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
No.  I didn't say that.
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Beth left?
I thought she was with you.
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
Help me lift her.
Gimme a second --
You got her?
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
That's right.
Is it?
Do you?
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
The ships?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
What report?
You've heard of me?
Huh?
He's a pussy.
Please, Ted.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
I'm not afraid of anything...
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
You saw through me?
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Have you been checked out?
What's that?
It could be worse...
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
You and me, huh ?
It looks like an... asteroid.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
I don't want everyone to see.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
That was just a mix up.
Yes, ma'am !
Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
No way, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Guess you gotta go.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
You used to dance...
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Courage, I guess.
Hi, mom.
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Been better, buddy.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Uh, I don't know.
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Yes, sir...
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Viewer, standard ahead.
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Mr. Decker... ?
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Nope.
Yes.
It's...
Yes...
I understand...
That whole...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...lost the screw...
"Room Service!"
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
It's for your finger.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
...because if you don't, they die...
Where you going?
What?
No, that's true.
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
Now you're talking...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Morning.
After Drama Group.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
What are they offering?
I beg your pardon?
We did...?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Big day last night.
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
They think it's your First Wife...
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Isn't he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Bourbon and Milk.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Tell it with...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
I've always seen that.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
You have to what?
What's his name?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Oh.
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I know, I know.
...yes...
And you know what...?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
You said <u>three</u>...?
Doug, this is Mr...
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Okay...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
Yes.
He should be put in jail.
What?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
I'm very sorry I...
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Um, no.
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
That's what I said.
We don't have the money.
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
George, that is so kind of you.
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
Oh, yeh.
Here.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
You think this is funny?
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
There you are!
Cos she loves you.
Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
No.
Alright starve.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Yes...if you like big hair...
If you want me to hate her I will.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Let's take our best shot.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Good...Well...Take care.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
A lot smaller.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Get out!
Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
She was angry at herself.
How the hell would you know?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Ironic, huh?
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
And you said...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Not yet.
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
He isn't.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Your story was terrible!
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Maybe. She's OK.
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Great!
Yeah.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
How many?
Three.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
Thanks man.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Who's got matches?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Used to Filmore, used to.
I guess not Cooper...
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
I don't want any...
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
There's enough in one vial...
Possibly some coffee?
Yes, of course.
The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes?
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
I know that, sir.
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Where, sir?
Right.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
What the hell is Plan-R?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
Then there's no chance for recall?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Lothar, take your checks now.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Speed?
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Seond safety.
Master Kong.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Hell, he looks dead.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Sure, King.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't know.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Can I have some?
It was pretty bad, huh?
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
What?
It's your birthday?
The dude wants it.
Sorry.
Ah!
Watch out for that tree.
No, no.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, I mean, no one.
Yeah.
What, they're looking for her?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Bullshit.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Great.
Shit.
Alright, Pony!
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I will.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Are you talking to me?
Good. See you later.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Oh, you were there?
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Sooze wants to see him.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
What? What'd you do?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Yes.
Oh, shit.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
No.
That's right.
Yes.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Oh, yeah?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yes, you do.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
For a ride.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, good.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Would I get paid?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah.
You do?
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Whatever.
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Positive.
And they get caught!
She thinks you went to the police.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
I sure do.
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Well, I want to know what happened --
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Uh...maybe?
They could kill you.
My best friend got pregnant.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
How about the Rainbow Room?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
You'll be waiting for me?
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Twenty-two.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
I just don't.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Come on in, Betty,
Whose?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Come on, Joe.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Where do you live?
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You'll like it here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.

What's that?
Cut out that us business.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
Good.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That isn't true! Max?
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
Go on in.
You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
Is that so!
Right with you.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
We can't do that.
You don't like me? You hate me?
But I don't understand.
I'm not mad at you.
What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I know it.
Nurse!
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
How do you know?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You're supposed to guess.
Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
I'd rather not talk about it.
But what for?
He's nice.
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
I'd love to.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Not yet.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Brad.
Nope.  Never. 
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You're welcome...??
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Oh. You're going away.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
Thirty-five.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
One.  And a half.
I don't think you understand.
Decaffeinated too?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
First question got to be "Where."
Anything.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
What about you?
Thank ...you.
I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Where do you usually find a light switch?
He can have mine. Anytime.
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Why do I have to do this?
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
We can get to work on that oil!
I do?
Be my guest.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Oh come on, that's ridic -
I didn't think I wanted to.
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Never closed my eyes.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
What else could I do?
Lois, I really don't see why --
Everything on it.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
I want my Liberace record back tonight.
Why?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Stay. I will come to you.
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
If you say so. Here goes.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Absolutely!
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
But why the hair?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Lucky I brought my drums.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
I know.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
He may have a gun!
You're just jealous.
No thanks.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
Bingo!
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
You?! How about me?
Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
I know...
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
I mean the other one!
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Wha'...what are you doing here?
You think they're strange?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
What about it?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
But...why?
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
On radio waves?
And garbage doors.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
They'll soon be over.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Which one?
Which clinic?
Then...when did she get better?
That's okay.
I understand.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Yeah.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Billy, please.  The children.
The children.
How?
No.  It should be dry by now.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Well I don't.
Why did you do that, Billy?

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
What do you mean?
I did.
Anything you didn't understand?
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Isn't it a lovely day?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
It's like a song.
Okay.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Yes.
Should I keep reading?
I'm absolutely positive.
Was the bus on time?
Indian?
Yes.
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You think someone else caused the accident?
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
No.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
Really?
You mean it?
Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
Great.
Okay.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
You don't know that.
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Is it news to you?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
I'll listen one more minute.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
And who's feet is she on now?
Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
The renting agent and the tailor.
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, stop it please...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
No way!
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Smile?
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Terminated.
I order you not to!
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
SHOOT!!!!
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
Then what?
Can you get us in there, past security?
I don't know.
Respect your elders and your betters!
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
'Dim-shits'?
What's that mean?
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Then you're going to kill me.
And your father was executed.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Why were they going to arrest you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Von der Null?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I have no idea.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Who's conducting?
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Yes, you remember.
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Nope.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
First oboe.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
I'll do the same for you sometime.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
I volunteered.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
About what?
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Why?
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Good fighters.
Kyle...
I just called.
Like shit, boss.
Projections were far too optimistic.
What?
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
Oh.  FIne.
Yes... well...
You're the one who started running.
Why... ?
Is this you?
Okay.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Nicholas...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Stop talking...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Stop it!
Happy Birthday, man.
Never better.
No.
Trust me.  Call that number.
Why would you say that?
Do it for YOU.
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Of course, Nick...
Yes.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
It's all down to this...
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
The key?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Not much, I think.
I'm just like him.
Did you worry about him?
What?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Don't ask.
Follow me.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Sam...  Thank you.
You warm my heart.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Yeah.
Why?
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
No.
Yeah.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
No.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Then who called me?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Nell, what do we do?
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why'd she kill herself?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I have a loft.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
-- but the painting!
I do.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
We think?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
No one else is even here yet.
Again?
You look alike.
Not her brand.
How d'you mean?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Now who's being sarcastic?
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
That's what was estimated.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Right.
Why not.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
He alive to see this?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Poor baby.
Eh?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
And that is?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Where else?
Yeah.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Lemme break.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
What do you think?
Tell me.
Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
Ann--
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
We've certainly missed you.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
Uh-huh.
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
Cash.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
Uh-huh.
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
...Huh?
Mm.
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Yeah.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
He's the dead guy.
Birdy...
Hello, Walter.
Yeah--
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Could you come with me please?
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
No.
I'm in.
I appreciate that.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
You're kidding.
Oh.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
The sub-basement?
Everybody.  Get behind me.
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
What is it?
Big as a house.
But at what a price.
So what?
How does it work?
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
Gone.
Vince!
It's scared of me.
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
Oh God!  Help!
I have to shoot.
One.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
It has to be the reality.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
I...I can't.
You think so?
I can't tonight.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Your Dad?!
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I made macaroni.
I'm not hungry.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
So why do you want to go?
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
You're welcome, Truman.
I'd ask for identification.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Is it an emergency?
You got some kind of business with him?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
A plague?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
You can't.
You didn't know my father --
I think they have that covered.
I'm in the vending room.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
According to this tag.
What kind of infection?
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
Mulder --
Come on!
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I'm not taking any chances.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Lucien Baines?
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
That's my girl.
Do you think that's funny?
Evil.
What happened to Charles Gish?
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
I doubt that.
Sit down.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Whiskey.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I thought you wanted...
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Oh...
He's safe in the Russian zone.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Yes.
It wasn't important.
It's true then?
I don't know.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Good-bye.
Yes, of course.
Fellow called Lime.
Best thing that ever happened...
What are you trying to say?
Ever seen one?
A bruised lip.
I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
I know a very good dentist.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
It's good to see you, Holly.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
What did he say?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
Hear the details.
Who?
Must be some mistake.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Not necessarily.
Here.
Big?
Yes.
No.
Exactly.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
I don't, but...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I don't care about money.
You will.
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
Where'd you read all that stuff?
What's he care about?
No.
What assholes.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
No. What are you looking for?
And be crushed.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Did you see how they reacted to him?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
How would you kill him?
It's the truth....
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
I don't know. Is that right?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Female...
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Of course they're Jews.
Are all Jews the same?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
You're lying.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
I don't do that.
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Do I give a shit?
Valentine...
Fund-raising??
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.
Does he know?
No.
Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
What kind?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Yes.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Have you known him long?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
That idiot!
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
What does that mean?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
It isn't lit yet.
Enzo...
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
... And his friend, Johana...
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I can't.
No... in the hut.
I don't know... why?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Thank you...
My wallet.
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... The way she moves.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
It's me again.
You'll try again tomorrow?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
Anything.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Then, goodbye.
... Yes?
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
He's still working out some identity issues.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
A stereo type alarm system?
Take a look.
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Nice fellow?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Oh, that's so interesting!
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
More or less.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
Yes, but what sort of a man?
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Tell me.
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Then you found the leopard --
Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
I know. Funerals.
Yes. Do you mind?
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Perhaps I should come back when youre...
You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
How... When did you...
Leon hung himself.
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
You bastard...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that.
Something like that?
Simplify and damn.
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
I dont know. Everyones dead...
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
Crow what?
Yeah.
Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Tomorrow?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
What kids?
The company. We all work for the company.
What company?
How are you, Jane?
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
I hope its not too significant.
Recommended?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
Jah...
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
What is?
What are you talking about?
Have you?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
No...
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Tu sais o me trouver.
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
If he had, youd be dead.
Are they still operative?
What do you think?
Majesty, I can't...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Do you think I could have some water?
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Well...
What... what do you mean?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
No, but...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
But it is what I want.
I -- I don't understand...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
I'll be right here... I promise.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
He's feeling wonderful.
... You look wonderful...
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Go and ask him yourself.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Never look behind -- only ahead!
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
No.
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
My father's.
Is that bad?
Who are you?
Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What?
What?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
It costs.
Who's recruiting?
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
That makes a change.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Hungry.
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
There are always notices going up.
Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I'm not going anywhere.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Yes, it's unholy.
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
I don't want to learn.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
I just want to listen.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Tomorrow.
That's right.
Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
No, no cops!
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.
No, not a thing.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
The name is Lonnegan.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
But what about all these other people?
What the hell for?
All right, when?
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
Maybe a couple million.
I am after this race.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We missed him.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Come on, gimme a break.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Do you suppose.....  ?
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Yes... yes.
Gilbert!
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
No.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
--was Wynant's.
About three.
Goodbye.
Let him have his say out.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Want to take a poke at him?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
I never had it.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
No.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No word at all?
S'long.
You're always teasing.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Much better, thanks.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Breakfast.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. 
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Who gave it to you?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
I don't believe he did it.
So am I.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
It was his body that was buried there.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Well, don't they?
Why not?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
Why are you saying it?
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
You did.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
Break it out.
We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
Let me see the map.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Maybe I do.
It's a combat action.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
What if I do?
And let me guess who is.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Invest it.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
You can't tell anybody about this.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
We're not going to do anything.
Get up off your ass and dig!
It's giving.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Makes two of us.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
We go this way.
Somebody has to.
Then I'm a rich man.
What?
I don't know.
People are suffering.
Now you need me.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Yeah, we're down.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
What?
It's 3+27 hundred
You don't know.  You don't....
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
What?
But you can't.  We must escape.
Impossible!
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I was lost.
...and you're not lost now?
I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
No!....
All right...
Where are they?
You the Bomb Squad?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Right.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Where you guys at?
Should we head for the Interstate?
How the hell do you feel yellow?
A bowling alley.
Reilly! He's loaded!
People are dying.
Alex, please.
What? Nobody, I-
But sir--
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
No!
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Constantinople?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Smart. London, eh?
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron.
I don't want to see you at all!
Um-hum!
Just as you say, Doctor.
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
Thank you!
The six--
Darling!
What?
Yes!  Now don't worry!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
By the way, how is your German?
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Then you go into the foyer.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Naturally I did.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Too much blue in crimson.
Right!
Um-hum ...
Beautiful.
No--yours, madame.
And you're going to fall for them.
You're conceited--
But I don't want to be a lady.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Call the police?
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
Lovely.
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
Well--uh--yes and no.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I beg your pardon!
Then why did you do it?
Yes, my bag!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
You're certain?
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
The one on the other side is letting men in.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
She knows.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I was tired.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
No.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Jack.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
A mistake?
Sssshh. Come here.
He does landscapes.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
I'll be right back.
I'm so cold.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
It would be a nice change from you.
Oh--a hundred times--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Montana?
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
Guess again, copper.
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Yes--
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Brett is the name.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
At seven-thirty?
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
Don't let's talk about it.
What?--
Yes--I remember--
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
We coulda got two third-class!
Shortie, look!
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Change?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Yes--Me--in person!
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Is this your gun?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
What's the matter, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
So what?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
--you'd go with him!
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I was in his cabin--
Then why did you run away?
Because you ran after me.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
Yes, very.  And very married.
Not now.  I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Yeah, you look it.
Here it come: one-two-
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
There's no reasoning with him.
Good God, you're really-
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Fun though, wasn't it?
You're a little touchy about it.
Just answer.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Getting late.  We better get back.
All right, well, good night.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
What're you talkin' about?
That didn't sound like thunder.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
So to speak.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
None of my business, Fred.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I'm on my way.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
What about the gold?
Where can I find him?
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
- Four wheel drive?
Is that any way to say hello?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Political considerations?
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
He tied one on.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
- The family jewels?
What?
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
You are seriously deranged.
Trust me.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I am. What do you want?
I was an attorney!
You leave me no alternative.
Approaching the first gate.
Get more men up there!
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
That's a lie.
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Oh here we go with that.
I ought to break your damn neck.
How old are you?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Now how far would further out be?
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
It would be nice.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Well, I would appreciate that.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Now who are we talking about?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Those boys never did have good luck.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
My mother passed on years ago.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
What must I do?
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Whadda ya think?
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
No, you can't.
Can!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
I'd better take a look anyway.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
But why would Andy want me?
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Everyone, it's Woody!
I got dibs on his hat!
Murderer!
What?
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Nothing.
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
What?!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Speed up!
Slink!  Hang on!
But you're Irish!
There's not.
Didn't you know he made things?
What about school?
Go away.
Ah, come on now!
I finished it off.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
In my pocket.
Everything is gone, now.
Storms?
In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
You're late for breakfast.
I don't know what you mean.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Why are you talking like that?
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
How much do I pay him?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
This is different.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Honey, your father knows the President.
What do you think?
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long's the job?
Parents still together?
I'm third in my class.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
Arizona.
Yeah!
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
I don't know.  Something.
Where?
I feel like a traitor.
An informant.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
Well, I've not brought them.
Bit fucking late, like.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Where are you going, Diane?
I'm going home.
Eh-
think I left something back at the -
Shut up.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Fuck, OK.
Do you recall the school motto?
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Nightmare.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Running time?
The park?
What about The Untouchables?
What's wrong, Allison?
I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
It was my fucking television.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Excellent.
Sounds great, Swanney.
That's fair enough.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
Pavel.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Have the Klingons responded?
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
I gotta sit down.
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I don't get it.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
I mean I want both of us to go.
That Dillinger's on to him.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Yeah...?
Oh. Anything else?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Not a chance.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
I'm sorry -
User requests are what computers are for.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
Not us, I hope.
What's wrong with that area?
It's too far!
Shhhhh.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
It's a flat. But wait a micro...
I'm shocked.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
I have a book report.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Why?
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
No way.  Not Dana.
Will you just open the door!					*
She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
You tell on me, I tell on you.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Sorry.
But you didn't.  Why not?
I adore it.
It's certainly... dramatic.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Sure.  Say that now.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Yeah, it was wild.
My husband the hero.
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
Do you still love your husband?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
No.  Doris.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
Harry... snap out of it!
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Dance?
Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Hold that thought.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I'm married!
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
His wife.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
Want some Goobers?
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
There's nothing to tell.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Where are you from.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What kinda music do you like?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
That's a long time.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
What did he do to Arlene?
I don't believe so.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Is this a joke?
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
I heard that.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Naw naw!
Take that shit somewhere else.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
No thanks.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Let me handle this.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Really?
How 'bout me what?
No problems on both counts.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Me too, Boris.
I bullshitted him.
I'm your son.
Do tell. Why drug related?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
Step inside.
Where'd you come from?
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Just put it in your purse.
No way, Jos.
We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
And your only goal is...???
So that...???
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
This is April, right?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
James, why don't we...?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What...???
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
How did you find me?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
I'm sorry, I didn't--
All right, old man.  Christ.
Yeah, yeah.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
Out of here.
How much.
One way, or round trip?
You own this place?
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
I want my car.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
You didn't hear something?
The wind isn't blowing.
That's all right.  I got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Thank you.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Come here.
What?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
Yeah.
From?
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
You've got to be--
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I did?
I'm not rambling.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
You know what I mean.
No.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
What's your name anyway?
You expect me to believe that?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Not as bad as it looks.
What for?
Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
No!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
About things.  About your wife.
You meant it.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
How do you want it?
And tell her what?
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Got any requests?
Cause she's dead.
Yep.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
How much time?
Time.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
I don't know your real name.
I like that about me, beautiful.
You sure you can manage?
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
You know what I want.
Nothing.
Is it pretty?
What about us?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Can you make it back up?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
How much?
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Beck's.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
What was that all about?
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
There's someone in the house.
Oh.
What does that mean?
I know.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
out again?
What was that?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Is there a problem?
Like what?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
We are.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
There's nothing to do.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I lied.
All of it.
Fine.
In the passenger car?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
Why?
Innocent of what?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
Ah, I see.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days? I must be.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Yeah. See?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
No?
Property.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
Letters?
You were there?
What?
A sign on him?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
N-no, sir?
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
I got him.
Yeah.
First one what?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
She gave me the evil eye.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Easy, Bill, easy.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Nothin's bent.
I don't like the question.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
Bear with me here...
And ?
They want more time to think about investing.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They'll never stop.
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Alright.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
If you'll just let me -
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
You okay?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Just do what I tell you.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Neither do we.
Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
Which is shit.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
This is totally irrelevant.
I don't.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
NO.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Ah.  How did they treat you?
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
We thought it was just.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
When she...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...We did everything we could...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Objection.
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
'Code Blue'...
It's a common medical term.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Right.  Who called?
Why?
The most respected ...
... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Why is that?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
I've got to work.
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
I...do you want me to leave?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Stop pressuring me...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
You use their witness.
Yeah.  I'm awake.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I used to be a nurse.
Yes...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
I married into it.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Almost a year.
No, I'm all right.
No.
What happened?
What about?
Let me come in.
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
Salina, Kansas!
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
How does it work?
Why?
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
Some money.
No...
When?
Oh... wandering about.
You like it, too.
No.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
Only silence. It's always like this.
When?
Long ago...
How do you know?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
Yes --
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Oh, yes!
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
What is her name?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I've never run across one like that.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Could be.
That!?!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Did you need it?
Yeah.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
By whom?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Excellent.
I need a drink.
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
What's that?
I didn't hear you.
First of all...
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
I don't know why the floor was wet!
What did you say?
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
What are you doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Why?
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Sure, why not.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Later.
Are you solid with that?
Don't ever stare him down.
I won't do it.
It has to be done.
Well, oh...
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
That's right.
Here's his head.
Well, I didn't mean it.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
No.
Now?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell you didn't!
Moore?
False.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
What?
They need leadership.
Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
You said nobody would miss her.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Florist?
Why?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Charles Moore for instants.
He's weird.
You expect more what?
You will not be common!!!
How much?
Not padded ones.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Maybe.
I love you.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Just a bit of organizing.
Okay.
I'm working on it.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
Okay. Okay.
Do you love me?
What?
Call the police.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
But...
No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
Like how?
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
You're not breathing right?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Have another drink.
All week long.
Where?
Yup.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
That's right.
You'd like me to kill them?
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
That's fifteen by seven?
But why? Why?
What are you going to do?
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Do they worry you that much, then?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Don't say that.
There's been an accident.
Where?
I'm afraid.
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I've had a gutful of this.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
That will soon pass. It's nothing.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
He was a computer program for crissake.
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
Only because I got pulled out early.
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
Show me his physical sensory level.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Of course you are.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
As a matter of fact, it is.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
This isn't a game, Parker!
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Authority still makes me nervous.
Both.
No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
Thanks.
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Duck!
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
What can it hurt.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
...twelve years.
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Who's got the story? 
All I need is the one day.
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Tell me again.
Yes
...that's the general idea.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Get on this, right now...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
Fine. 
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
Where is he?
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
I have.
...you the Press Office?
Well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...it's a Teaser!
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
Stanley.  Stanley... you knew the... Stanley.  You knew the deal when you signed <u>on</u>.
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
No problem.  Here's the...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
Why...?
...who <u>are</u> you?  Who <u>are</u> you sonofabitches... 
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
Whatever night you like.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
What'd you tell him?
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Dump it.
Gordon.
Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
I gather you're a decorator.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
And what do you want?
...how do you know? You wish...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
It's over you, Gordon.
I can't...and I won't.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Have a nice day  sir
A party at a waxwork huh?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
A little?
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
Six six and six
Sell my soul?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
I know that.
Of course you will.
That's not true.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
What do you think I should do?
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
I've never even met you.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
You do?
Very much.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
He was so pissed.
She's making this up.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Absolutely.
What?
The planchette?
But Claire--
Jody he was lying.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Did you call the police?
Of course.
What kind of whispering?
Yep.
"...for my father."
I'm so sorry.
Did you tell her?
What am I looking at?
I didn't do that.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When?
Tonight?
I never said...
Sweetheart--
Claire, please...
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
It's Madison Fra--
We don't know that for sure.
She can't be here without me.
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
He made that quite clear, yes.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I had you sent away.
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
Better than most, I suppose.
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
FAST.
uh - then he - be just -
If you knew how I yearn for that...

Go away!  I don't want you here.
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
And whose houses do you design...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Their what...?
No.    This is unreal...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Talking to me dear...?
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Stop it!
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
I heard something like that
I'm sorry - I didn't think
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Sure...
I think I will pass...
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Where do you kill them...
I don't want to talk about it -
Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
STEPHANIE?
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
He doesn't need to...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I better go, Dad.
Check it out!
And some really fast cars.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
God, I love being dead.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
If you don't have...I mean...
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
What do you want me to do?
They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
My legacy.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
I miss them, too.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
I have absolutely no intention--
--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Let's do it.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I'm trembling with excitement.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
Take your time.
Try, Kelly.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Suzie?
You have someplace to be?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
I said he did.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
Police -- God -- get a life.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Where, the mall?
I won't.
You know what it takes.
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
Funny.  So am I.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Almost?
Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
It's better than nothing.
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Oh, I would hope not.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
My friend?
Nicely said, sir.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It is?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Then come with us.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
Let me see it.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
You hear trouble.
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Fresh goat's milk.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
You?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Somebody has to do it.
Me neither!
You're the guardian, aren't you?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Sorry. It's important.
Just do it!
Pretty much.
No pistol. Ever.
What's that, Sam?
Maybe.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Johnny 
You have no right to keep us here.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I was wrong.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Anything against zippers?
I know what he said.
A real fireball.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
I didn't even know about it.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Say again?
Wrong.
Yes.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
His name is John Book.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
I have committed no sin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
No, they won't - honestly.
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Has it poppies on the wall....
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Did you say something?
Oh...
Oh --!
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
The nerve.
Because I'm still scared!
Did they hurtcha?
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
They would?
Oh --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
It's too late!  There they....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
It did?
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
NO!
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
A heart --
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Well, that's you all over.
Oh --
Yes -- how about Dorothy?
You promised us real things -- a real...
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Alright then, brunch.
But what if...
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
You knew him well?
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
How would you know?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
Jon -- for Gods sake, what do you see?
The missing scientists.
Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
They're practically on us . . .
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
I don't know their real names.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
I'm sorry about Blake.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
What is this place?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Why is that?
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
What do I get out of it?
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Naturally.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
Aren't you afraid?
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Why you dogging me up?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Of course.
This is a gift. From me to you.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
For what purpose?
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
He takes himself seriously.
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
You mutant bastards...
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
ALIVE.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
What was your grandfather's name?
Yes, sir.
I did, sir.
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
MMmmm.
Promise??
Very....very!
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
That's my good boy.
Will there be anything else?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
No.
The wockers with the knockers.
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
This guy means business.
More, do you hear me?
What?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Is everything ready?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
How's everything?
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Inga, wake up!
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
What do you think we should do?
Stop -- singing!!!
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Four
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Do you have a reservation?
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Thank you.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
