No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
What do you think?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Patrick -- is that- a.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
You got him involved?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Leave my sister alone.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
I'm on it
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Have you seen him?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
And I'm in control of it.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Acting the way we do.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
State trooper?
No.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
I thought you were punishing me.
Right.
What?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Tumescent!
Have a great time, honey!
I am, Your Eminence
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
She said yes.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
I want to go with you!
Father...
You defend yourself admirably...
... and also to bring medicine.
Passion is something one cannot control!
What are you saying?
New worlds create new people.
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
We're lost!
You tell that to them!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What's your cut?  How much?
But it's...
What else do you need?
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?
Is he your boyfriend?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Who do you think, Chief?!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Vodka tonic.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Pretty.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yeah.
That's unique.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Who is he?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that fucking thing off!
How you erase this?
Let me get a shot of it.
Emil???!
I can get you a job.
It's easy to learn.
Robert...?
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
I used an accelerant.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
This is three years old.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Whaddya mean, buy?
I never paid for it in my life.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I got a lot to protect.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Thank you.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Now, where we goin', convict?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
We split 50-50?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Do I get to kiss her too?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I got to wait for a call.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
You're hopeless.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Call me later.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hey, I don't believe it.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Where is he?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
You want to go outside?
Corn-i-Lius?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
What are we going to do?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
Who?
Yeah?
How many points you got left on your license?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
30 seconds...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
You hear that?
Dinoine chagantakat!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
It's up to you now, Angel!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Exactly.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
At least I won lunch.
Thanks..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Welcome home.
I'm not accusing you...
How's the detective business?
I love you.
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Is it?
And they are?
I'll consider it.
What's the problem?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Call me Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Eddie.
What the fuck are you.. ?
I told you, I don't know.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Give me the film.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Sounds good, pops.
Snuff films.
I don't know, where are yours?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
You've found missing persons before.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Those are her belongings.
Rick...I can't.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
You what?
You've been up all night?
How long have you been awake?
You look great!
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
What's wrong with me?
What?
What is it?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Very funny.
Had kind of a long night.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
You, too?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Reef!
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Seems to be all around...
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Under <u>water</u>?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
We bought you.
Mmm.
They said.
No, I mean whereabouts.
What blood?
Sure you did.
Break stuff?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Jesus, why?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Did you get his number?
I still don't understand --
Yeah.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Think they're alright?
This is nuts.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
It makes me sad.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
He's asleep. We were up very late.
What?
Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
His office. You mean my old office.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Bang!
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Which is?
Then who shot him?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Alice...
How was...  ...the ballet?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Got it.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Dead.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
How?
Tower, here.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
And all these rooms here?
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
I know he left you behind.
Do you have to be so brutal?
No.
Over my dead body.
Stop.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What's going on?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Yeah, right.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Did you feel that?
Shut down accelerators.
Te...!
Ted!  What are you...?
Elaine, what's going on?
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Roger.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No.  Poached.  Over.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
George Zipp said that?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
We'd better get back now.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I'm Randy.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
What is this?
Get the picture?
Why did you do it?
Back off, George.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
We all did.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What is it?
That where Anderson worked?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
The human?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Can't lock up...
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
No.  There's no way!
You son of a bitch.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
What is it?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
...We're coming in.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well you're not reading it right!
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
They're in the approach corridor.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Looks like it stung him.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
They cut the power.
Nine meters.  Eight.
And how are we today?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Did you ever have a baby?
Look, I told you...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
What?
Is she a good fuck?
Sir -
Where?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Wolfi!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
No. Don't answer it!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
What for?
Why you?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Behold!
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
My pleasure.
Yes?
Why so?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Yes, Sire.
Who told you this, Majesty?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Is she not here?
How is your financial situation?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
Is he working?
That's right.
What did he say? What did he say?
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
You burned the score?
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
The man. He's here.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
I think so.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
You mean in Turkey?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
No, but I'm the best.
Who is on this committee?
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
What do you want?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Well?
I did.
I poisoned his life.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Yes?
He said 'Jack'.
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
It was a wolf.
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Will you come with me?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
The kitchen.
No.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
What time is it?
Alex?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Are you cold?
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Ask them what the candles are for.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
I heard that.
Heathcliffe.
What's the plan?
Oh shit. What is that?
See anything?
Jack?
I'll tell you when we get there.
I'm going completely crazy.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Jack, are you really dead?
Hello.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Hot chocolate?
Oh.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Where you been?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
What good will that do?
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
know, but
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Doesn't that come next?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
My apartment.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Well . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
If he can do it, yes.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Did you talk to him?
What time was it?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
wasn't anywhere near this place
Then who changed it?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
How many of them did he kill?
But if we take their money and supplies...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
What?
I could use the walk.
Where you boys going?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Jesse, we got to have a word.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
What the --
So?
Frank, don't you have something to say?
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You know him?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Oh yeah.
Jim was old enough...
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Little ones.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
I don't understand.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Hmm.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Yes?
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I think so.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
There's only four of them...
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
THEN WHO DID?!
Parker.
This is him.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Dorsia's nice.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
I haven't seen you around here.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
I want a firm commitment.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
What exactly do you mean?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
That's Paul Owen.
Maybe it's just the light.
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Jean? What?
What are I doing?
Why?
Just...say...no!
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
What?
She's my...cousin.
Who?
No.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
You sure?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
We were both seven in 1969.
No.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Yes.
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...
Al.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What're you -- what?
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
I can't just walk away!
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Nothing.
What?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
...What?
It's gonna get cold.
No.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
What?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Longitude 109 --
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
You know mine.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
Why were you so careless?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Does he know you know?
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Yes Basil?
My mother's told me all about you.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Why did you leave so soon?
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
You know who.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
I'll hurry back.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Kiss me.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
What are you saying, son?
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
In due time.
Blow me.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Why?
Did you ever want to?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
Hope...
How long have I been here?
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
We want to help...!
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
1922. Why the kippers?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
I didn't. Mother did.
My father always wanted a boy.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Any ideas?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Is that what you think?
Do you always drive this fast?
This must be the last straw.
Was I?
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Not for a moment.
I thought you played by the rules.
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Our chaperon.
Decontamination -- ?
Surveillance? By whom?
Getting to what?
Global warming?
How did you guess?
Are you alright, young man?
No, please! I beg you ...
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Great car.
I love that car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I can't sleep.
What's the matter?
That feels so great.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
What are you talking about, asshole?
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Is that all the coke in the place?
You want to share it?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
What the hell is that?
Under the table!
He look familiar?
Very.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Just come down, John. Just --
Been ripping off fire stations?
What, you've never seen one before?
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
You look great.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Hi.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Hi.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
So what do you want me to do?
Yeah. Big fan.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
What?
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Management were pin heads.
Fireman shit?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
The great communicator.
He treats you okay?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
"Don?"
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
Yeah.
Nah...
Let me think about it.
Do you have the money?
How's the case going?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Everybody say Ho!
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I'm feelin' dis'!
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
I don't know about that plantation angle.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
This has to be a big mistake.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
You lost me.
You getting cold feet?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
Which one is your brother?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He, I'm Mona.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Money and nothing else?
I heard ya lady is wild.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Say what, Manray?
I know I won't be your puppet.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
And his baggage?
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Have you had one?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, of course.
Papa?
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Can I at least have a drink?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Yeah, right...
You saw West's body.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
I... I don't know...
I didn't kill him --
But you didn't.
Is it the truth?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
Why?
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
Where are they!
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Yeah.
That's horseshit and you know it.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
I plan to grow on you.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
I pushed him too hard.
No.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
We should tell him we're not going.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
It won't work --
The fuck are you talking about --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
You won't find a better place!
Then do it.
You get the eye?
What did she look like?
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I'll...
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Did you do any of that?
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
Did I ever tell you about how...
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
They're your favorite flower.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
Were you and my father having an affair?
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
You're not.
Of course.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Was she one of your teachers?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
What?
Right.
I...
No. It is too judgmental.
No. It's not that.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Where's the restroom?
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Just wanted to see.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
For your hands?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
What happened?
You been home yet?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
You gonna steal my truck?
Rose... please...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Want another?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Sorry.
Huh?
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
Naw!
Nuh-uh.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
Why's his britches round his knees?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Why she got a chain on her?
I skipped lunch.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Are you wasted?
Get rid of it.
What are they doing now?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Not a prayer.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
This the right place?
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
What'd she say?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Did I say that?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
No...
Nick, you can't do this.
You did great, Ichiro.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
He drinks.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
We're in?
No one's keeping him here.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
This by this...
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
I planned on catching him, Captain.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
The families who control the casinos?
Good.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
What's the point?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
I've done some questionable things.
Also extraordinary things.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
He's not ready yet.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I want to do it.
What was he after?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Well, when do you get paid?
Yes?
Do you have something against science?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
What's that?
Yeah?
You sure?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Do you dream?
Black?
Is this to be an empathy test?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
But how come I'd be there?
You want to go home?
What about friends?
I'm hungry, J.F.
You look... better.
Just better.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
My office.
Well, that depends...
Let's go talk first, Adam.
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Right.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Take it. damn it!
I haven't brushed yet.
See, ya.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Because I want to get married.
I didn't know that.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
When do you need her by?
Thank-Q!
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
Adam?!
I'm leaving, too.
Sing it to me.
Yes, Eve?
It was at least as good as the sky.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Is this because of the radiation?
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Well, do we just go on up?!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Russia.
You bet!
Bye, Adam!
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
What?  What is it?!
Help you?
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Yes?
We have to go.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
What about relatives?
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
It's time.
How long will we have to stay down here?
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
I'm not hungry.
If I...you know...
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Calvin!
Would you excuse me?
Yes, yes it is!
No.
Yes.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Alright, I will.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
What?
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
To get some frozen poultry.
What?!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
It must be great.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey nothing.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No.
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Who is Don?
Yes.
Frank is coming?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I guess I should go.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Where are we going, Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Hello?
No thanks.
Heineken.
What?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Alright.
So, what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Yeah?
Okay, be careful.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Stop it Mike.
Just for him?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Hey, I just...
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
What happened?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
What the fuck are you doing?
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
You guys?
What?! What are you doin'?
Yeah, we promise.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Nine bodies.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
She was in here when it went down.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What?
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Who the...
Right now.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
Hurry the fuck up!
So?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Don't do this my son.
Father, I'll do you right here.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
He's a nigger.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
When'd he tell you?
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
I'm not. But there's --
She needed it.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Shit, Dignan.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
I'll see you there.
I'll get him.
He did?
Yeah.
Pretty much everything.
What do you mean?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
That's a sharp jacket.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Did Dignan take the test?
Are you afraid?
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Why do you say that?
You OK, Bob?
It's in the driveway.
What do you mean?
What's he doing here?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
They are.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
You stole a Trans-Am.
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
How much is there?
You really think he'll remember you?
Way to go, Bob!
Is he chasing us?
My brother's in jail.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Where's Applejack?
Applejack drove.
What's that?
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I'm working on it.
I might have mentioned it.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Join the party, fellas.
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't... 
Where's that guy going?
Well, I left some money in there.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Treadstone.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Why not? It was just money.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You still should've moved.
Conklin.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
Conklin up front.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
Where are you going?
See that tram coming around the corner?
Say it.
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Who's going? Us?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Yes. In that order.
Young Robert, we are honored --
Does anyone know his politics?
Now, my flower, do you understand?
The little cow is insane --
The Bruce is not coming, William.
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Let her speak.
I do not confess.
I want... to marry you!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
You will die! It will be awful!
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Anything.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
All the dads are gonna be there.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
I know, but...
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
And...?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Smells like sex in here.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Just get out, didja?
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
My husband is with me, too.
So you decided to go to America.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I won't.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
You haven't heard my offer.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
And Mademoiselle?
Occupied France?
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
And I was wondering.
Why there is no other man in my life?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
You can believe that if you want to.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Please.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
Everything is quite all right.
But why my name, Richard?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Goodnight.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Are you ready Ilsa?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
I beg your pardon?
Well, this might come in handy.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
I understand.
No, Captain, please.
My bill.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
You will give us the names?
For the time being.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
I was misinformed.
What, again?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
This is the end of the chase.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Oh, it's my party.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Yeah? Why?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Huh?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
You're late.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Are my eyes really brown?
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
He'll double what I pay you.
No. Not me, boss.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Thirsty.
Get water!
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
What's so damn funny?
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
I've got lots of time.
He is a cute thing.
This isn't working out.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
Anything else?
Need some help?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You fucked us over.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
These *credentials* are against the law!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
How many months are you?
Where's Mandalay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Hi...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
Where are you going?
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
But she's your *daughter*...
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Don't this place look like home?
I told him that you all is sick.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Rose Rose has runned away!
Tough day?
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
I can see why you liked her.
I was doing it for them.
So we go to the bar.
Who's that?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Well, this is just fucking great...
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Calls?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
I think two million.
I need you to stake me.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Attractive girl.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
You're just going to have to trust me.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
It's what I do. It's my job.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
How do you deal with --
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
What about what?
What do you want? An apology?
We're working for the King.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What?
Ten percent.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I despise the job.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
She went back to South Africa.
I don't gamble.
Last hand.
I get it.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I've got something to tell you.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
Are you trying to read my palm?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Marion. It's a book.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
You're entitled to your opinion.
There was a message, wasn't there?
I hate public transport.
So how are you doing, dad?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
There's a casino in this hotel.
In the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
I'm in trouble.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
How much do you owe?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
What for?
Yes.
I don't think we should meet again.
Where to?
Nice car.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
And the girls?
No thanks.
What happened to Bella?
Where's the magnet?
Ever?
Girlfriend?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
What's he doin'?
Key?
Fuck that shit.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Hey, bomb...
And you can only do it once, right?
Yes, well...
So if you detonate in...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Pinback...
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Wha?
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
I need a diameter approximation.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Doolittle! Help me.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Yeah?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
No?
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
How come I never hearda you before?
Some of us are trying to sleep.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
What are you doing here?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Whoever that is.
So what are you gonna do about it?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
How well do you remember the lab?
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
You don't want to.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...
Only one I can think of.
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Tell everybody hey.
Hey, Sketchy--
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
I was on call. 
I want you on call here.
Huh?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
What the fuck!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
That's it?
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Simplicity, Hawk.
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
I did?
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
GOOD MORNING!
Hi... what's going on here?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Dea ex machina...
Why did you make me flood the school?
You have a request?
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Frank.
Four times... so far.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
Why?
God exists because you're horny.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Yeah.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
What I think is going on with your son.
Come again?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
How did this happen?
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
There's no rule!
You're what?!
Okay.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Airport Ho-Jo!
Amber...
Oh shit!
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Yes...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
We was robbed.
That bitch from...
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
The king can do to wrong! 
Who to?
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
What's the matter with you?
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
Oh no, I can't do it.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
No... it was a seven letter word.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Did it go well, darling?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Yes?
What is it?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Has the response picked up?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
How long has this man been here?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
I don't know what I've got.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
You're English.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes.
John... Merrick
Mmmerrick.
This... is my new home?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Very smart indeed.
And who might you be, sir?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What was she like?
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
What do you see, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
I'm sure it's lovely.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Is there something the matter with it?
Yes.
Shut up.
I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
You told them I raped you -- why?
"But" what?
How deep IS the ocean?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
Just say something cheerful.
ROW!
Vanish into thin air?
He hasn't.
No, I'm not.
Let me go, Sven.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Get away, Snorri.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
YOU do it!
Shut up!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Dad!
Yes, Mum.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
May I help you?
Okay, I guess.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Probably see you at the book store.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
I'm fine.
Well, I should probably get going.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
No.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Okay.
You should stay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
You'll call me, right?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
I want to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
No.
Such a beautiful view.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
What do you mean?
You remember what happened next?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Happy Birthday.
This is our first "date" date.
Well, you're married.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You said...
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Seems too coincidental that way.
Male or female?
What are you doing?
Bye, Joel.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I don't know. Panties and --
I just got in.
It was snowing.
I should maybe talk to you.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
Okay. I wish you could come.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Sorry. I just --
It's stopped.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Oh.
Yes?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Thanks.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
It was a mutual decision.
It's an apartment.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Just wanted to let you know.
She likes you okay.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
That's Jellybean!
What guy?
What are you doing?
So now you're bummin' around?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
A job for me?
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Ballast.
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
From what?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
Coop, where are you...
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
What's happening?
Please...
What's wrong?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Jesus its huge.
Skipper...
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
The date.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Heading three-three-four...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Where is it, where is it...
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Miller, come in...
...repeat, we're armed...
No. I saw nothing.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
Explosive decompression.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What about his first born?
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
He's made a few changes.
What the --!
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Reed?... Sue?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
He's not responsive --
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You two need a time-out.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Yes, thanks.
For science.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
And reverse the mutations --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Oh, I think you already have.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
How much did they cost?
Easy, mon.
Hi, Brad.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Any problems?
They were left over from the last shift.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone.
Do you have any ice tea?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
We've got to get an abortion?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Really?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
Damone, are you there?
Well, I've gotta be running.
No Damone. I don't understand.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Who's that?
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
What should I do?
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Do you think guys find that attractive?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
We keep them.
I had a really nice time tonight.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Hell, no!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Jesus.
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
WELL? What are your plans?
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Could I have that, please?
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Spare me.
I will not die because of him!
IS IT CLEAR?!
Yeah.
I don't think you should...
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
We just smeared a skunk.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Come on!
I'm in.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Sure.
How much you got?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He only shot you once.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
Four door?
Open?
I wouldn't do that, son.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Move it!
Yeah, maybe.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Get to your cars!
You know you don't have to do this.
We all have to be strong, right?
What did we say about lying?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
What does Clifford say?
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Showdown.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Bye, baby.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
And you think it's worth all this?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Francie, you know I can't do that.
You can always come see it in London.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
They'll mend.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Not me. But other people seem to.
You think I'd miss it?
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
You don't know what you want.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Serious, huh?
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
The hell you will, Harry York.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Where are we, mean man?
Huh?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
How did I look?
What'd you do?
Shit!
What?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
I don't believe so.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Nice.
You're an outcast.
People can be kinder than you think.
Your crime... as well as mine.
I see it before me.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Materials. Nothing more.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
I'll have to do better than that.
I've loved you all my life
You make me weak.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
What sort of task?
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Professor?
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
Thank you, Henry.
For what?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Re-configure the leads?
Ah. An explorer.
Creature? A... human like creature?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
What'd you see?
Good night, Alice.
Any particular reason?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
You can only do what you can do.
I'll go check on Brenda.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I had to.
You just had some lucky shots.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Are you wet?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
How'd she die?
Died instantly?
Is this real?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Why not, against your religion?
What did you call me?
You too, preacher?
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
You're gonna let us go?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Not even for lunch?
Whiskey!
You believe me don't cha?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Do they have a waterbed?
All I'm saying --
What'd ya see?
Cops.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
I don't know, you just passed out.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What?
You know what you look like?
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Thank you, ensign.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
Standing right here in my office.
Then good night.
Sir?  What did he say?
Entering my scan now...
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
"The Lark Report."
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
California.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
O'Neil?
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
I'd sure like to know who.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
She part of the training?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
That's not right.
I think you're the liar.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Got it.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Women.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
What are you doing?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
How do you know?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Wish me luck!
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Did you talk with Humphries?
Merde!
And how should we do that, Sir?
You're fast.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you sure? How do you know?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
I think we should leave now.
How do I do that?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Settle down, Alex...
Shut up.
You have a better plan, Alex?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
What?
Oh.  Okay.
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Okay, we got it.
But you don't?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-
Lt. Madison, GO.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
Where are the miners?
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Hi everybody.
Tell them? About...
There's nobody here. Jason...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Right.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
That's it, It's go time.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
You... You mean Earth?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Where?
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Yessir.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
Who's in command out there?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Oh, come now...
Any word from Canada?
Colonel Reed...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
No, please; an advance on your salary.
I only meant...
And how rusty are these muskets?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
What is it, Marquis?
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
To win this war I need an army.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Martha!  For God's sake!
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
What the hell are we doing?
But not more than your comfort.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Where... do those men come from, George?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
You're out of your mind!
They can use their imaginations.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I guess still in the locker.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get the money?
And that's for the airport.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Get something going there.
She's... young.
I can't do it.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
C-18.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Ray Barboni?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Why would I do that?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Leo spanked a waitress?
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Yeah, he told me.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
One of mine?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
It's all mine.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Not yet.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Harry... My God...
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
Pick 'n' Save.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Fucker!
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
One more?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Get up.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Goddamit, Dodge.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Bodies're too fresh.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Dodge to Murphy.
What is it?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the hell happened!
Could be a fishing boat.
No.
Lights?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
So what did happen?
Why not call for help?
But where's the damage?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
It's not gonna hold us.
Hey.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
What's that supposed to mean?
What do we do with him?
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
What?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
Call the Coastguard?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I don't know.
You don't remember?
Say what?
Oh, man.
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
No, no. You got leak.
Are you still looking for a job?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
So what do you think?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Huh?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
So Josh...
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
That's just the way I am!
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Hi Enid.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Did you sign up yet?
Or maybe not.
I might actually get the pasta special.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
There's my dad with Joanie.
It's obviously him!
What's he doing now?
Are you sure?
He's insane!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
"Funky"?
Just promise you'll do it.
Where are we going?
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I know a party we could go to...
It's a surprise.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Like what?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Go ahead...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Just some people from work...
He came into work.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Hi.
We're not.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
Didn't they tell you?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
Oops! I dropped it!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
For nineteen years...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
So, what happened?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
I had to see you.
Uh... sure... come in.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
What about Joe?
What?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Did she say that?
What do you mean?
Let me see the sick.
No hints, Samuel.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Finish your tour?
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Second death? Where?-
What a good week.
You mean nobody died?
Good luck.
What are they looking at?
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
And where will you sleep beautifully?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Do you ever see him?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
You're really good, you know.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I'm not even good for me.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
Yes, the scourge --
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
Like what?
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
From where -- Neptune?
Who was that?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
I'm Ray --
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
What happened?
My Fault!
Ready?
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Now that's one ugly dude.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
That's too bad.
Well, let's check it out.
Damn!
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
I want you to have this. 
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Nervous?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Does she want to be?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Looked at with your eyes.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Where are you, Pete?
Judgement Day ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Yes?  Go on!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Where is my father?
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I've read of it.
But have never been?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
What the hell was all that about?
Serious stuff...
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Let him trust Quintus.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Yes.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
You mean the one who --
I'm meeting someone.
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
What?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Because it isn't true.
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.
But you might.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
One of those outside agitators.
Mr. McCleery?
Yes.
Mrs. Robinson?
What?
A single room or a double room?
What for?
Drink?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Yes.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Let me out!
He didn't see me.
I haven't. No.
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Thank you.
Either one will be fine.
Are you tired of it?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Don't you?
No.
Do you really want me to?
What one.
What novel did you read.
He's asleep.
Always?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Right.
Well how long has this been going on.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Not particularly.
At college.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
I was just kidding around.
No.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
I see.
Now it seems to me --
Very good, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
Why?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Oh no.
What?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
I know.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Thank you.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I will.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Hello.
Yes?
Can you see me now?
I don't believe it.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
And what are you going to do?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Reducing?
Chasing what?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
How tired you are!
Am I quite strange to you?
Go away. Who are you --?
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
No?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
I don't want them now.
And now?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
We could come to my room.
All right then.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I must have made a mistake.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Is that for me?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
You're tired. I can see that.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
What...! --
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Well -- you want me?
Can you pay some attention to me?
Come here. 
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Sorry, Preysing. 
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I can't dance tonight --
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Madam has slept well?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Hurry, Suzette.
I wish to be alone.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I don't know you.
I could not think of not accepting.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
Just one moment, sir.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
My son --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Want a look?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Just myself.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
I tripped over a chair.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Going somewhere?
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
At what?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
You want a drink?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Roy?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
The long end. Big con.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Upstate where?
Yeah?
Open your door.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What?
) What?
Roy Dillon?
Yes?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
That's that, then.
Mr. Simms.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
I can be real stiff.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
You sure?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Get on the bus.
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Not me.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
Shane's going as a condom.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Where's the baby?!
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
What is that?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Miss me, baby?
A bitch.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
Go home!
What'll you do for transportation?
Could have happened to anybody.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
How do you know that?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Maybe it's time you got out.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Blue soup.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
You're my buddy.
Life has denied me that thrill.
Is anybody besides you here now?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
He insults him all the time.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Can't it keep till morning?
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Damn.
Mom?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
You don't even know me.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
We all are.
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
A trip, you mean?
Breakfast?
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
If he wants to go.
A dozen?
Just one favor.
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Blue soup?
You're begging him to kill you?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And her fianc!
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I was going to ask.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Good Lord.
What for?
What brought you back?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
Correct.
You're old--so old.
You hope.
I've struck my blow.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
Poison.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
I'm only ten years old.
Because he was cruel?
Thank God!
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thank you, kind sir.
Where will you be?
Yes, he is.
Father's friend.
That's why I'm crying.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Everything stays as it is!
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
It's true.
Take plenty of cigars.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
You fool, you fool.
Do it!
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Yeah.
Do you want to take a session?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...
You want a tip?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Yeah, yeah...
I don't know no Tod.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Overpowering?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
No.
Yeah.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
You don't drink?
Of Joanne's?
And your wife? Where's she?
You don't understand shit.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
What makes you so sure?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Did you find out where she was?
Andy.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
No.
What's it called?
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm only human, you know.
It's just a name.
Wes, do me a favor.
Where does he hang out?
Well...
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Fifty cents admission.
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
Maybe. Maybe not.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
How long have you been driving?
Could I see your registration?
Your tree.
None of that, lady.
We planted it.
Not very.
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Yes.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
It goes on and on.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Why do you say that?
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
But this is public property.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
What were you fighting for?
He's stopped.
I don't know.
The ice is melting.
I like Glaucus.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
With God?
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Would you like a cigarette?
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
And a lot of time.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
You liked your teachers?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Harold!
We've always been here.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Who?
See what??
Don't get psychic with me.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Do you believe in hell?
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
She's dead.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
What are you trying to say?
You call that thing a cigar??
Whatcha looking at, John??
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Well good n-
Are you sure about this?
Alone?
You better have that looked at.
Goodnight, then.
Hi.
Got her mother's looks.
Let me alone, will you?
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
No.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
Who did?
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
You're still blaming me.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
I'm here.
Dead.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
I suppose not.
What happened to me?
Who brought me in here?
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I got through.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Big house.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
I'm afraid it's true.
I won't be able to stand.
I'm here.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Are you busy after work ?
I'll come back later, huh?
You gotta be kidding me.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
What did he ever do to you?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
What's up?
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
They always seemed...
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
On Clark Street!
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Pardon me?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
What do you mean, four more?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
Great.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
What's this?
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
I dunno.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Nevermind.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
So, how are you?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Don't forget your CDs.
Hello.
What do you mean?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Let's go home.  Okay?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
It's true!
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Which way are you going?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Naw.  Those are for us.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
How old is Richard?
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
He was unsual.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Grave robbers?
Why not?
Tradition.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're a fool.
What's all that?
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
Why are you here?
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
That would be difficult to explain.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
What are you getting at, Moran?
I want Taupin.
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Good way to lose your job.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
I don't believe him.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
How can I stop such a man?
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
I'm your future husband, remember?
Far away.
Not so scared.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Stay out of it.
Where!
Smith.  Carl Smith.
The last four.
_Answer_ me.
And have you something to settle with me?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
Run!
Tradition.
We have some unfinished business.
And if I refuse?
Did you know the victim?
What are you getting at?
No.
Are you back?
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
Yes, wasn't it?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
How long would the interview take?
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
What?!!
No, I can't.
Sure you can. Come on.
You've had a better offer, eh?
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Bermuda.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
You said it.
What do you mean?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Exclusive? That's great.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
She jumped out of the window.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Huh!
All the words you've got.
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Will you come here?
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Hildy!
Thanks.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Who do you want?
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Sure, boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
There's money in it, Cooley.
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, that about covers everything.
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Boy, did you see her go?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
A sight for sore eyes!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I can't.
Where's the old lady?
There goes another scrub lady.
Any news?
You fight it cut.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Come on with that money!
Here!
You know it is!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
That man there!
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who? Me?
The City Sealer's office!
Why not?
Get the cops, somebody.
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
Give him the you-know-what.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
Can't we just see the end?
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
Well, for the baby, really.
I don't know?
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
How's your war, Mac?
You joined up.
And what's that?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
The ideas you get in your head.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
You're having me on, Molly.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Which way?
Is your brother ready to go?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
No, really.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
She's pretty cute.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Check this out.
Goddamn.
How long is that gonna take?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Oh.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
When?
Thank you.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Don't even say it.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
I'm gonna go ask him.
I'll go. It's my fault.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Jesus Christ.
Mr. Willis?
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
What about the body you found?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Aw, fuck.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
Tell him, Harold.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Oui.
We still have you and I.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
That's what I'm counting on.
Progress!
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Yes, darling.
Flares?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
All right.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
No.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I had sold my fucking soul.
You were gone a long time.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Extra dessert?
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
You want a chaser?
Give me a bottle of beer.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
That's the way it's done.
Oh, about five hundred.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Poker's not your game.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
Sign up.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Hey, Findley's here.
I'll beat him the next game.
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
He's my partner.
It's quiet.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Get with what?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
How much?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
What's the limit?
How long you been waiting?
What?
Have a nice trip?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Then why go to the bus station?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
So why go to college?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
You got it all in your head?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
What's this supposed to mean?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
You wanna drink?
Well, he owns things.
Well, what's so funny?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Fifty-seven.
He went off someplace.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Thousand dollars a game.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
Yes.
What choice did I have -- ?!
What do you mean?
Yes.
You want me to stay?
You and that damned garden.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
What's that, Dad?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
It was so real, Dad.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
I don't see anything.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
What's his family background?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
What do you want?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
Are you all right?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
What happened?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
College nickname.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You punched the President in the face?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Pops, you're a genius!
Oh shit, we're late.
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
And our troops here?
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Really? You don't mind?
Sorry for what?
Dick-weed.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stop it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Air... water... your "sun."
Dad?
Dad was onto something here!
Yes. Now we know.
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Where did this come from?
Doctor Jones?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
At least I let you tag along.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
If only I could have been with you.
They want my diary.
My lucky charm.
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
My Diary's in Berlin.
What about Marcus?
Those people are trying to kill us!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I'll take the camels.
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
There are no stories anymore.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Dr. Jones.
What's that?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
No, the stones are mine!
What evil?
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
India...
Indy! Help me!
Just one arm!
THE WHAT?!
Don't catch cold.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
A fulcrum release lever!
What is it...?
What're we going to do?!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Don't do that.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Who are you?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
Are you threatening me?
Yep.
Why not?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
I want out.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Just walk down the hall?
Which way do I go?
A lab and equipment.
Who did?
Gone where?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'm at the airport.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What do we do?
Use my credit cards.
What? What do you mean?
What was?
Try another language.
What?
Touch her.
Where are you going?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Now, where would I be?
What did that cost?
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Where are you going?
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
He was with Gruner!
Not sure at all.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Do it.
There's a lot you don't know.
What exactly?
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
It'll remind me of you.
What kind of a deal?
You've cut your hair?
Sir?
It may have been affected.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
Here?
Not you. Them.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
The fresh tuna?..
The poet...something he said...
I can't do that?
And you?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
You talk to yourself.
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
And you, what do you like?
Why?
Who did?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
And Dieter.
And you?
Now what?
I asked him.
What?
What did you tell them?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
What is it?
What could you find in this place?
Excuse me?
Why not?
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
I'll take some.
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Three hours.
When's your deadline?
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Maybe later.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
I'm not touching my film...
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
A gun? Yes.
Okay. 
How grave?
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Hey, Lowell.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Uh, what are those boxes?
Soy sauce...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
...taping?  What are you taping?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
We're there.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Hardly new news.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
How have you liked your stay?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
How much would I get paid?
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Why?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I don't think you really understand --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
What?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What do you mean there is no family?
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
He --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
You're in a rush.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
What?
Thanks, buddy.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What do you mean, was.
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I begged you to have a baby!
It sounded like a bell.
I assume this is on Rex?
You just haven't met the right person.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Have you tried the duck?
And here I thought my mother was...
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Huh?
Did you just propose to me?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
That's blackmail.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Pre-Castro.
Hello, Rex.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
He was right, wasn't he?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Wait. I know you.
Yes?
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Thank you.
Ah.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
She always looked out for me.
I am very sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Extinguish?
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
OhMary
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami  for the love of it?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You only met him once .
I'm sorry you read it.
Why should she? After all
If you really mean it, I will.
It's my daughter! Go after her.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
All right, let it go.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh, yeah?
What am I going to do now?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
That's none of your business.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
No. No. It's too good a story.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Thanks, professor.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
What's the matter?
Why, haven't you?
You think it's simple, huh?
Amazing.
Here comes a car!
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Husband?
Why, he'll be back.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
SorryI didn't mean to
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
What time is it?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
ain't got a hat
I ain't got a hat.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
There's a seat over there for you.
Thanks. 
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Whyno
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
Who?
Bill.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
But why?
Yeah.
What's it look like, Nick?
I did.
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
Calm down, Dave, what?
You still questioning any Cubans?
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
No, you don't!
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Honey, you all right? 
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
My sympathies.
Get a hold of yourself.
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Between six and seven seconds.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Well, thanks for coming.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...and your General?
Ever ask him?
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
That sounds fun.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I know. That's why I went.
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
I need a favor.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
This is your money?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Help yourself.
I gave you my card there.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
I'd love one, but not there.
Why does it need to be dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
Ordell pick up his bond?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
What'dya think?
He told me last night.
He called you?
What?... What'd you do?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
You don't actually do it that way?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Set him up.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
That's Ordell's.
I didn't say you did.
Spain.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Oh, Miss Brown?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
What for?
She told you that?
Was she there?
You said that the last time.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
Where's the bag she gave you?
There was a guy with Melanie?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
For what?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Who?
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
So we need two people, two women.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Plus the same deal as before.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
What does she think she's gettin?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Who's paging you?
It's boring, isn't it?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
You're fourteen years old here?
Must of made quite an impression.
That sounds like a problem.
Wanna fuck?
We're leaving now!
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
I dunno.
The moon -- I dunno
Who was that?
I didn't look like a bum.
Sure.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Couldn't talk to her?
In the chest and stomach.
Where you shot her.
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Yeah.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Was she?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
I'm alone.
Well, give it to me then.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
In a way, yes.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Who is it?
We're back.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What are you then?
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
I see.
Daddy. Let go.
It's short, huh?
Short? It's ended.
They're not interested, Jake.
What are you talking about?
Maybe the demons are real.
I'm hanging up.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I thought you said she didn't say much.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had this weird flash just then.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
I haven't seen her in months.
I don't know what to say.
But I see them.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
They're weird names.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Lemme see.
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Jake!
When was the last time I said a word?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
They're like demons, Jez.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Why? What for?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
What'd the doctor say?
Am I home?
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
What's he talking about?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Where are they?
I'm not upset.
Then don't bug me.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
WHO ARE YOU?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Shows how much you knew.
You come here often?
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
He's burning up.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
Clear the area. This is an order!
Lennox Hospital.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
A long time.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
Can I help you?
Pour it in.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Minimal.
Hey! I'm not ready.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Jesus what the hell is that?
I'm with you kid.
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
See? We're not so bad.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
And what's with the headgear?
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
I'm gonna spew.
I'm just saying.
Kay-em you okay?
Something's wrong.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
It's my charter. My party.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
Who's driving the boat?
I never saw one that big.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
What's that one, there?
Don't forget these.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Colorful, isn't he?
You going to be all right?
What'll I tell the kids?
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
What stinks so bad?
You all right?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
You from around here?
Some friends and me took a house.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is that a boat?
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
I'm supposed to be running.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Is that normal?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
We're getting a stretch limo.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
No...
What, you mean as friends?
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
What are you talking about?
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
I'm a junior.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
Blood and guts.
Oh.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
When was this, like '96?
We definitely want it to have junk.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
Uh, thanks.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
I actually know this one.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Oh really?
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Your name, please?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Excuse me?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Touche.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
A Pilates machine?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
What?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
...Anything else?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Now why is that?
What happened to Adele?
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
You were plenty hot.
His Parole Officer.
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Where would we find him?
...That'd be my guess.
Yeah.
Right.
Are you hungry?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I know what you mean.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Nothen' B.
Na.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
You were?
Yeah?
I'm nervous.
What do I want to do?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Come dance.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Sorry.
Hello.
You are being ripped open.
Did you bleed?
I hate sucking dick!
What happened?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yep.
It's like...
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate 'em.
You've heard the stories right?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
It's me. Telly.
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Yeah.
Right.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
What do you think?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Why does he call Sanderson?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
What do you mean, stand out?
Who is this?
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
You'll find her.
Just like who?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
By that time the game will be over.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
No problem.  We're in.
Nope.  Nothing.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Same as the others?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Did you see his face?
Through a rental agency.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.
Then I'll transpose.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Feel like practicing?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
You have to win every point, don't you?
Of course.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It was.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
You.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
Frank told me.
It's over now.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
I lied.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
In the Arctic ice.
Turold's son was to marry her.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
You choose these?
What do you see?
I cannot reach her.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Even by you?
Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
Well, I'm not impressed.
These we'll pay for.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Would you settle for a boar?
No.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
I knew.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Yes. We lost five.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
No, she was not as beautiful.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
...What?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Yeah.
130... 140...
It's incredible! How did you do it?
What?
You were scared, weren't you?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Mathilda? May I come in?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
Mathilda?!
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
Yes.
...OK... Good.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Salute.
What is it?
Why am I such an authority?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
What?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I want children.
You've just decided, is that right?
That's okay -- really it is.
Where?
Why there?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Doubts?  About what?
Is that right?
You tell stories?
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
This story is big huh?
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
Phileas Fogg?
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
... My father.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
It's yours.
What are my choices?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Do you want to fuck now?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
I know that...
What do you mean?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Your color.
Can we just forget it?
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
You know I love you... yeah?
How'd this happen?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
I want this, Sera. I need this!
A full night on the street and this is all?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
What alibi?
I can't tell you.
I loved him!
Were you with another man?
You're fired. I have new representation.
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
No!
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Sit down.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
-- his life?
You can't even imagine.
That's terrible!
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
How'd it go at the trial?
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Really?
What?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Josh proposed!
Why?
Projecting joy is not my job.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
How could this happen?
What?
What're you doing here?!
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Thank you. Having fun?
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
You look -- nice.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Is it a Kappa?
Then we smash 'em?
We come watch... we come watch...
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
My generosity is not so large as that.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
East of Mercia?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
We be honored, friend Ogg.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Pregnant, is she?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
We must follow that bird.
This is ogre's magic.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Nice piece of work.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Easily spoken...
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Never show mercy!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Go on... go on...
Never.
Unicorn?
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I'll go search for it.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
What happened?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
I don't want it on me.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
What have I done?
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
What's this now?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
You'll visit again?
Courage, Jack.
Jest with me then.
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
And as barren of love as stone.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Be fair, Oona.
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
You've been inside?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I wanna be with you today.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Don't you have school?
Did you feel anything?
You look better without make-up.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
Floating to Catalina.
I have the permit.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I hate this job.
George, this is the third time.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
To check up on me?
You don't have a choice.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Are you totally insane?!
No.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
A friend of yours is here.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You can't make me do a thing.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
Good for you.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
God, you look like crap, George.
Oh.  Sorry.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
A blueprint spool.
I don't have a phone.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
It makes me sad.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
It's not breakfast yet.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Where's Sam?
I smiled at him.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I thought we were helping.
I'm married.
No.  Mostly me.
I could die.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
To shave your chest?
I'm helping George build his house.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Hey.
What are you doing in my room?
Adam, that's not true!
Nigger.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
Not for me, it ain't.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Why not?
She got married last month.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
What?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
What's up, Ray?
Yeah.
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Him?
It's a pardon from the governor.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
What?!
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
So?
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
It'll be too late.
I prefer bourbon.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Who?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Let her go.
Little Nicky.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
My mom wasn't a goat?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
But those are my roommate's sodas...
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
I mean... tough break.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Thanks.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Schnapps...
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You keep a bat under your seat?
Good idea... kill me.
Hello.
You got the wrong window again, man.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Don't do it.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Off limits.
Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Had enough?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
You missed something special.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
I thought I had to do something.
And?
I changed my mind.
About what?
Where did you get that?
And then you killed him, right?
I don't..
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Are you taking me to them?
How do we know this is the right way?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
What's that?
I doubt it.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
No.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
What kind of place is this?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Good... You up for a drive?
They're comin' with us.
Why not?
Very strange.
You recognize that guy?
What a fuckin' job.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
I was here yesterday.
Me, too.
It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
He'll kill us.
So what do we do?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Andy, who is that guy?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Sure.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Sit down a minute.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Out in back.
You talk to him?
Where is he now?
You just gonna let him go?
Who is it?
Who is this man?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.
Something wrong?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
That's why I married you.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
I told you to stay in the car!
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
It'll be ready.
Okay.
What?
Who is this?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Why haven't you called me?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Not even a radio?
Fossils, huh?
Well, what do you know about that!
Uh-huh.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
That's ridiculous.
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
No kidding?
Yes.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Charming chap.
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
buy and sell?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Well, is it?
You're startled?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
Please let me help you.
Now, what would you like to do?
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Are you so certain you are away from it?
As far away as I ever want to be.
How can we get in touch with them?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Yes.
You're lying, aren't you?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Hurray!
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Oh, stop it!
What is it? Has he fainted?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
I don't need any proof.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
What about the others?
I guess we're in for it.
What is?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Struggling, why?
I'd love it!
Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
You'll wait till you rot!
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
What the hell...
Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
What's going on, Kay?
What if he's telling the truth?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Why not?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
What do we do?
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Where's he making his big speech?
How'd you know?
They're inside.
Forget that guy --
Agatha...
Anderton --
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
They were performance pieces.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
You the sentry?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
What?
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Because it was going to fall.
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
You set me up...
Sean --
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Some -- somebody's father?
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
What about the picture --
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You say some of the children died?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Where?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
This is all my fault.
Who?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
Cream and sugar.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
You mean after he lost your son.
But John was with him at the pool?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
What was it then?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
What, sir?
So, wait, you're from where?
Holy shit.
Bullshit.
No.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Yeah? You sure?
So, when's the drop.
How bad is it?
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
So what do we do?
Yeah?
Heard of them.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
They were out of line --
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
I don't understand.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
Yeah. Sure.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
A bad heart.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
What about it?
It's not losing record.
I got no idea.
Then why do you try to get in?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Yeah, I guess.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
How'd they know who you were?
They asked who it was.
What the fuck is that supposed --
He woulda told us right?
What the fuck was that about?
He wants to see us now.
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Put that shit out...
We need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Eighty five.
Calm down.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Where do you get this shit?
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
Kinda. Yeah.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
What's up, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes?
How do you know it's not drugs?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
'Strapped?'
Ow, shit...
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sure. You boys want anything?
Thanks.
Tell me.
The Red Dragon.
Solid, daddy.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Man live by his rep.
What you say?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Don't con me. Don't try...
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
Then the devil is white.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
What can I do for you?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Why do you ask?
How old are you, Betty?
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
Let's cancel.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Just what is your question?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
You put it very well.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
"His greatest greatness."
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
The sentences to run concurrently.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
So what about him?
You want to be the head man?
Who the hell are they?
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I don't know shit about you.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[South America.]
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Reina Rosas.]
[What is his name?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Who's he?]
Who's he?
[How much do you want?]
[What do you mean?]
[Lucky how?]
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
How do you think he got out?
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
I don't understand.
I know you're not.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You think too much?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[Yes.]
[No. Why?]
When?
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Hey, Herbie...
What?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
It must be one o'clock.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Well, it ain't your baby.
Ufa!
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Please...
Nothing.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So I'll die without a son.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
What, Ma?
So these two girls come over to the bar...
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
On accounta...
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Which hospital?
It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
You got directions?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Frank...
Give us this day our daily...
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
I was just asking...
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
You betcher ass, Dad.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
Radar!
For you, Trapper.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
All of them?
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
The bastards outconned us.
Very happily married.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
Yes, Reverend?
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What's wrong with him?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Good morning, Colonel.
Morning, Radar. How were things?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Can I help you pack?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
Money.
Better let me talk to him.
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
All set, Ann?
The Websters.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Hurry up, Pop.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Had any schooling?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Both of 'em?
The heelots!
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Sure.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Well?
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
It's for Ann . . .
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Yeah.
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Is there a crowd in the street?
I don't know.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Manual or automatic?
Who are you again?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Only at the very end.
How do you feel after a shooting.
I've rarely shot anyone.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Is there something wrong with that?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
Get good at it.
Why?
He's got the girl.
That's a chance I gotta take.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Please. I'm begging you.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's okay. We broke up.
Yeah?
Scottie...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Yeah.
Prude.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I want to be put on this case.
True.
Why?
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Your life that bad?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
Divinity?
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
How long?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Why would I do that?
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
Identical.  One's you.  One's digital.
I know.
Voice activate.
Resurrection.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Connect to public access.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Release the power WITH the power.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
NEW POWER COINS!!
Let's go after him!!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Hey, boss!
How'd you know?
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
You own a hotel, sir?
You've got the public upset, Al.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Poor, yeah.
No. Not everything.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Well...
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
For being a bootlegger?
Something came up.
Would it be painful for you?
You fellas got names?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Who?
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
You gotta plan these things.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
So tell me when I ain't done it.
The kid just called me stupid.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
I don't fuck my partners.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Shuddup.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
What a cozy little scene.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Best we got.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
<u>Why</u>??
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Sure. Why?
Got a doctor on duty.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Don't ask where I got it.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Mom, I need to talk to you.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
What happened?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
He's an organic farmer.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Where to?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
It couldn't be.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
What's this, Diz?
You know--little worms--ambition.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Yeah. Funny--
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
How about getting married?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
Henry Hill.
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Mr. President!
Will the Senator yield?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Yield *how*, sir?
Mr. President--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Fine--
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
How's Amos, Ma?
What is it?
Did you say--bus?
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
And with your help--
How?
Why?
Calendar?
What?
The Steering Committee.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Why?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Abigail.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Great.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Wait--
But--I've done everything I--
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Chick--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Why don't you do it yourself?
Well--me, too!
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Jim!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Senator Paine will state it!
Oh, yes.
He's still pixilated.
No.
Tell me more about yourself.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What are they going to do?
Have you seen the papers?
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
Huh?
I've often thought about going back.
Yeah, then what?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
You're acting like a school girl.
Look, I can do it!
With pay!
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Stuff, sir?
Sit over there, will you?
He's not home, I tell you!
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Where?
All set.
Why, no.
Will you have a cigar?
No?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Arthur wants to quit!
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Look, he's temperamental.
A what?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
What is your name?
Yes, ma'am.
You mean  by the neck or something?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Tails tonight, sir?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Yes, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Who?
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
What's that?
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Ernest, what do you think?
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What kind of doubts?
Why not?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
What?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What is it?
I've had my moments.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
Yes, your honor.
Oh?
Oh, I don't know...
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
Don't need it.
That would explain it.
What's happening here?
Ph.D., psychologist.
Could I see Sofie, please?
What can you tell me about this?
Maybe you'll catch it.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Sorry... I'm done.
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
Is that like a party trick?
It doesn't matter. Go on.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Yes.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
And this is legitimate therapy?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Okay...
Hello.
I guess you saw the show...?
Which show was that?
Sofie...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
Anything... just ask.
You got off easy.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
In maybe three or four issues.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
How are you?
I understand.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Slash what?
How's it coming?
You were messed up, man.
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Altar boys?
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
What are you doing here?
I just decked your brother
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
You know your history.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No you're not.
It's everybody's problem!
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
I'm staying.
Got it!
Got guts, lady.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
You lied to me!
I found it, Evy! I found it
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player.
Who's here!?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
Do I?
We could really use some coffee --
He was cute though.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Me, too.
Have you considered my offer?
I got it.
Against.
Just a waitress.
Who?
Roy.
What have they got that we ain't got?
At the Frankenstein Center.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
You're the Sphinx.
You drink too much.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
There's a big difference.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Sounds good.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
It's time.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
And, what a delightful idea!
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
There are none here.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Properly arranged, yes.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
I'm not insulted.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
When did it start?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Why didn't you wake me then?
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
How did it spread so quickly?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
That is correct.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
And now?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
I cannot promise you that.
I will never forgive you.
Promises mean nothing.
All right -- I promise.
Yes.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Why did you give it to him?
You wrote it.
You couldn't face telling me what?
My God, what do you think?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
And, where did you see my portrait?
What I am talking about is moderation.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
So.
You walked?
$247.
Naw, you go first.
What you see?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I will.  When can I come visit?
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Most definitely.
What are you doing here?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
Can I help you?
What it smell like?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
That the big one, huh?
What?!  What that mean?
I got fired too.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Just do it.
Ezal!  Ezal!
Need to lose some weight.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Amtrack?
Business or pleasure?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
I would also like to apologize.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
The gun...
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Tell me why I miss him.
You killed him.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
But...
Lynn!
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
All right. Kisses to you.
I said I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Yeah, all right, listen...
Hi.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
That one.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
I'm looking for them.
Put her on.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Where's your Mom?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
I been mindin' Pearl.
When'll the skiff be ready?
No.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
John! Don't!
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Where ye from?
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
I'll tell.
What?
Now: Where?
How old are you?
What's your name?
Yes; John's bad.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What you been up to?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
How can you tell?
Haven't slept, have you?
Uh-oh...
Okay?
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
Dad -- what you doing here?
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
School.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Screw sleep!
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
What you dream?
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Bring me forty-five back.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Yes.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You want this?
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
He's cutting our throat...
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
Monsieur.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Have you?
No, sir.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Business.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
You, please.
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
In other words you don't know.
Love to.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
I will start with you.
And what is your profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
The telephone is ringing.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
This is a place for workmen.
Why?
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
On which boat?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Anything, Ninotchka.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Shhh! Shhh!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Are we going to build our little house?
Yes... a little white house.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
...and we won't clench our fist...
Our salute will be a kiss.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Those newspaper people?
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Yes, Swana.
Months, Swana.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
She's gone, Leon.
Madame, if you...
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Well... that's my business, madame.
Thank you.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where is that?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Mr. President, I don't know what to say.  As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified.  He should be here any minute.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
I'll bet he would.
Where's Hunt now?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
We can't touch Hoover --
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
So?
I don't know anything about that.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
Their fourth!
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
I did?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Sir?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
No.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
You'll win the nomination.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Why, you got a customer?
You're fucking me.
Who we working for?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
What do you mean, Jack?
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
Yes.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
It was illegal, what he did.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Ernie Davis.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Elvis I like, too.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
What's in there?
It makes us human ...
I want a divorce.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Buddy? ...
Can I just ask for one thing?
They're all your enemies?
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
How'd you know I was here.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
Didn't know there was any.
What would you a done if he'd been released?
When did he die?
Most don't.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
Carla Jean...
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Well. Old age flattens a man.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You gonna drive out there?
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
I wouldn't worry about it.
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn.
Odessa.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
What makes you say that?
Where does he work?
Huh? What is...
What airport would you use.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Well... I need to close now --
No.
...Where you want me to put it?
Tent poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
You on all night?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
It's all right.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Okay. We can stop that.
Yes?
Could I get another room.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Waitin' for my wife.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
Not that way.
Were you in Nam?
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
You do, I reckon.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasn't a woman.
A woman can write a check.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
Great. Good. Content...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Who are these idiots?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
"Thirty-two?"
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I'm sorry.
...what're you saying?
Did you watch it yet?
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
You knew Del?!
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
How did you know?
What are you doing?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Fine. You got five...
I don't follow...
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
Should I kill him now?
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
How'd they describe her?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do you mean?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Would you say she was ambitious?
What did you say?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Waitaminute -
Hang on there -
...Pete?
What do we do now, Everett?
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Not out the other side his face, though.
Now Penny, stop that!
That's right, honey.
That's good, honey.
That's not my ring.
Well, we need that ring.
Who was fixing to betray us!
That don't make no sense!
Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
What's your name, boy?
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Yes, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
You're good.
What did you call me?
I called you Sarge.
Before that.
I didn't call you anything before that.
No, sir.
Louder!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
How late?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
What?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Really?
Be a friend. Leave.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I'll get it if you want.
Does it still hurt?
Hi.
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I'm looking for Sid.
So?
I'd like to come with you.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Jets.
Hey, you guys still awake?
That isn't true, is it?
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
But she expects you to marry her?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
You're welcome.
You should see the look on your face.
That's right.
Not that one.
Fuck.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
She's never coming out.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Ever read any Poe?
Got us in here, didn't I?
Shoulda got an apartment.
Damn it!
I heard you.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
He --
What?
Not an option.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man, fuck you!!!
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
I don't know. Look around man.
...Glad you came man.
Naw... I gotta...
Now hold on Rodgers...
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
So talk...
You were. infantry right?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Just a kid.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Rose?
Yeah... cop hit me...
No.
When?
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
Well?
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
You look well, Charlotte.
You couldn't have known.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
How can we end this madness?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is it?
What?
No, I don't.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Balderdash!
Where is he now?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Worse.
But father, they might come this way.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Please hurry.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Yeah, sure.
I'm sure you're not.
Do you swear?
You need a glass?
Not yet...how much further is it?
I can hardly read these.
Going to tell Ellie?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Is there quicksand?
It's funny, all right.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Why, then, things should be fine.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
That's forgotten.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
That so?
I'll drop it!
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
You have a name, missy?
Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
Then why aren't you eating?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
That would hardly be proper.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Difficult ... to say.
If I had known --
It doesn't!
You're in league with Barbossa!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
A fool's errand.
We're not going to just surrender!
Raise the sails.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
You threatened Miss Swann.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
I swear, you look just like him.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
On what?
Yes.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
What are you going to do to him?
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Then you still love me?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
Well, you got another problem.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Yes?
Yeah.
Nothing really worthwhile.
You're insane.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't?
That was an egg?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Just look at it!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
What's that supposed to mean?
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Did you go?
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
May I use your telephone?
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
No!
Thank you, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Conrad.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Who was that?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Stop calling me Mother!
I beg your pardon?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
And you struck him right here in our house?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Found no skeletons?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Mary Sue?
What do you mean?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I won't.
It's alright. Let me see.
All night?
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
What?
Okay, that's IT!!!
That's not going to happen!
Want some bridge mix?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Rain.
Well--it was dark out ...
Dan! Arrest them!
How'd you know about the fire?
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
Hello Bud.
Yes.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
We're supposed to be in school.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He won't notice anyway.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
The pages filled in?
Sure.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
How?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Can I open it?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
McGinty's.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
I can't.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
OW!
There's worse places.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Just listen to me ...
You know what I really like?
Oh, hi.
Dream come true, hunh?
Well, I can't talk though --
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
Hello.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
What's all this pudding?
You're so scared.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hello, this is Back.
Really?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
...yeah....well you have me now.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Me?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I don't know.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
...yes I did...?
Oh that's great.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
...yeah...
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
That was good.
Ok.
Yeah?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yes I'm sorry.
What is this?
I'm sorry.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Did you have my home phone number?
Yeah.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
I didn't do that.
The police are on their way.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Can we agree that that is that?
How's business?
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
I'm sorry.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes. Sorry.
Well....what do you want, then?
What are you doing?
Ok.
Yeah but I'm serious.
So they'll go.
Hello?
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
I'll just see you when you get back here.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
He's a writer, not a madman.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
There I was taxed; it's true.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Shut down?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Well?
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Did I frighten you?
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
They've taken your clothes?
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Oh, but I am!
Of course.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Doesn't that please you?
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
That poor woman.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
I did my best but, well, you know me
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
Louis
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
How much?
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
You are repellant when you drink.
Thank you for your time
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
Nope.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Jesus
Okay, boy wonder, what?
This better be good
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
I expected more from you.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Let me out.
Listen to me-
It doesn't have to be
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
They don't have to.
It's 350 pages long.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
Craig is one syllable
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
So they're Jews. . .
Christ.
Mank!
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
I think you better sit down
Oh God. . .
It was fun, wasn't it?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
About what?
This looks done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
What's wrong?
Sure. What is it?
You heard me, I said hit me.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Who's that?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Yeah, she's nice.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
Nah, she would never...
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
See? That's all there was to it.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
What?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
I just wanted to say hello.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
Come over here.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Who asked you?
What did I say?
What'd you see?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
What are you doing?
Don't make no difference no more.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
He should.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is the baby sitter.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Jefferies?
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Who said they left then?
If possible -- both.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
A detective's nightmare.
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Where?
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Like what?
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Something wrong?
Can you get me that ring back?
You're never going to marry?
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
Isn't he a salesman?
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
What about this morning? Any developments?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
No.
Hello.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Who's Thorwald?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Tired?
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
I have one now.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
That's what the witnesses told him.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I do?
Huh?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Do you like it?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
What's that?
A new disease.
Where can we meet?
Sure.  It's fine.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You still want to go home, Moose?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Will you let him tell it!
Will you wait a minute?
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
You remember me?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I know.  That's why I came back.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What?
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Who?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
No.  At dawn.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I need it.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
They like you.  Okay?
What?
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Do I have to spell it out?
No.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
He called me chicken.
Pretty mixed up?
Where what was.
You going there?
Yeah--why--
A what?
Goodbye!  See you!
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Where you going?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
So do you.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
That one?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I was talking to Dad.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Gabriel -- !
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel!
Is this him!?
-- till he fucked his parole --
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
Tell me again.
Beauty and fragrances.
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Nick, I love you --
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Nick...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
They'll have guns.
I'm almost done.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam Bam.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
I said, who the hell made the map?
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Don't tip.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
No way.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas...
What about the Powwow Safe?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Hell you haven't.
Not yet.
What?
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
GUARD! GUARD!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Yes.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Did the two of you talk?
Me and Mr. White?
A little.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
What?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
It's a change.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Give me my book.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
Freddy Newendyke.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Dead.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
What?
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
Well, he knows a little about me.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
You don't know how good it is to see you.
What's the matter with her?
Yes, ma'am.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Like what?
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
The who?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
What?
All my clothes --
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Go on, hit me.
I don't care what she asked you.
What did you come back for?
Yeah, how did you know?
I can't take her with me.
I don't care.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
What is it?
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
They shouldn't have done that.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Go on. Have another try at him.
How far up the trail?
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Gee, I can't.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
She was only teasin'.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
My favorite memory was when we --
Help!
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Maybe we can study together or something.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
What about you, Buddy?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Listen to me I --
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
What should we get?
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Oh, right.
Stop touching his brain!
Both of them?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Aww, the little bird died.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Right. What about condoms?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
What is it, Dwight?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Thanks, handyman.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
It says, "Ray."
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Bring her home... I guess.
Because it's the rules!
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
That's nice.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Hello.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Beverly, are you alright?
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
What's he know?
Where?
You can't tell.
You scared?
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Yes.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
But I like teaching school.
I ought to know.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Good.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Yes.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
Please, Jacqueline.
But you're always at the library.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
I have to go -
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
It's because of Jacqueline  I can't go on looking for her --
And you believe that?
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
But why come to me?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Would they hurt her?
It seems right to us.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
That was quick.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Do you want me to?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
What?
Of course not.
Ann. Hello.
No.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Yes.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Is he going to see this?
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
No.
That's correct.
What was the problem?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I can't.
I've told you.
I don't know.
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Always the lawyer.
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
What?
I have thought about it, yes.
Yeah, so?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Radon leakage?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
No, he left last week.
What brought this on?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I guess.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
I say it because it's descriptive.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
What's wrong with that?
Because I never got around to it.
No!
It looks like a tablecloth.
Do you have my work number?
I get real busy between two and four.
There's a phone here.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Is that what he tells you?
No.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Do you want me to stop calling?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Not for three-fifty.
Everybody has a past.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, nothing.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
Kiss, kiss?
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
We live in 703.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Fools!
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
Care to indulge?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
He was adopted you know.
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Sure thing.
Why?
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
F for...
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
What are you pouring tonight?
They're just leftovers.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Oh yeah.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
No, I'm an actor.
Just tell me.
Oh yeah. Much better.
What?
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
You still seeing that shrink?
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Sure I know Maya.
You know that chick?
She is very hot.
And she likes Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Beautiful.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
Well, she is cute.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Where were you?
I will.  See ya!
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
With Maya.
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
No.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Do you like them?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
We gotta go back.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
So what's the plan?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Hi.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Oh. You mean... today?
Sure.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Got it.
About two-thirty.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Sir, what are you doing?
Where's Jack?
It was a surprise, Mom.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
No.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
It was very dark.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Have they said anything about our area?
Don't touch him.
Graham.
They'll read our minds!
Did someone save me?
What about them?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Is he okay?
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
It's like War of the Worlds.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
You must have known that before you came.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
What's Turley like?
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
What happened?
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Who did it?
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Rae, all we got is each other.
I see you're prospering without me.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
It is that.
It's the only place I'm happy.
Where's the dog now?
That was my plan.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Please.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
"Forever".
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Everyone you know is lying.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
I do?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
Well, I --
Why?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Of course.
Yes, call me Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
You don't secretly want the attention?
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
Hal, what are you doing?
How did the wall get there?
I know what you mean.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You do?
Not quite how I imagined it --
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Why?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
One thing bothered me.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
I'm keeping it in trust.
What now, Sayer?
She looks a lot like you.
Don't you?
We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Maybe he can.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
You mean aneurysm.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
I don't tell her a thing.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
What?
Dr. Crowe.
Can I ask you then?
Yes.
I have to.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
No.
What are you thinking, Momma?
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
They want me to do things for them.
Like what?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Get off his case sweetie.
I happen to be a professional.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Carl, what are you doing?
Gene.
I could. You sucked.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
Harvest moonshining!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Name something.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
Suzie... No.
I almost thought for a second...
Like your guitar break.
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
What?
Sorry.
Pretty, ain't they?
Oh, yeah?
Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
What's she see in that douchebag?
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
I never danced in a towel before.
Welcome home.
Okay.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
What's he get if he wins here?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Who'd want to?
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You could've asked.
An unmarked police car.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
And?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
One to five?
Absolutely.
Why should I?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
How long's this gonna take?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Hit the brakes!
What does the old Timex say?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
We're gone.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
I'm all ears.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Shut up, Fred.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
That's correct.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Anything on the Swede?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I've got concerns.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Okay.
About what?
...I'm sorry...
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
It's the last place they'd look.
You're finished.
...Does he know?
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
-- okay, g'head --
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Shoot.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
For real?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
I DON'T KNOW!
You'll end up like me.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
You fucking bastard...
Why, who did you see?
How much sleep do you need?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
No.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
You want to fuck her?
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
What's wrong.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Rheya --
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I want you here.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Would you pick one out, please?
Yeah.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Urdu and Hindi.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Yeah.  It was.
You put me life in danger.
Claire, will you calm down?
I do care about you!
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
Everyone's all right...?
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Tommy...!
Your what...?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Hey.  The neighbors.
Okay?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
I'm sorry.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Let me drive...
Ellie...
What about when she goes out?
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
At my house...!
We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Watch your step!
She's what?
Cause if you get in a bind--
No, no.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
I know.  I've got one too.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Yeah--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Some things you should say anyway.
Uh is a good start.
I'd never admit that.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Hello, Liz.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Jawohl!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Coming up.
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Break it off!
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
What some brandy?
Yeah.
What are the chances busting out of here?
What is your number?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
What do those broads say?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
What radio?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
What are we going to do with him?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Thirty-fifth.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
I do not want those cigarettes.
You heard him.
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
What do you mean?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
What happened to you?
Left behind?
Yes, where would you go?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
The Nexus.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Tractor beam, aye!
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Locate.
David!... What went wrong?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
This planet is aging in surges.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
None that I can detect, sir.
Captain, what's happening?!
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Yours...?!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
David?... David!
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
What you ask is difficult.
Understood, my lord.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
Physician, heal thyself.
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral?
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Now that's what I call a meal.
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Don't tell me you've got something.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
It's the Genesis Wave!
We encoded four minutes --
I didn't expect anything.
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
Is that what you came here to say?
No!
Departing dark side, Regula.
Tactical!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
What's she doing here?
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
The ship -- out of danger?
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Spock...!
Kirk here.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Power levels quite low, sir.
I really must thank you.
I can't get power, sir!
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
My name?
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Back to San Francisco.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Do you trust me?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Thanks. Cheers.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
Kirk. They're gone.
Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Yes.
Yes?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I meant --
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Humpbacked - people.?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
How long, Scotty?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
Transparent aluminum?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Don't you ever get tired?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Androids... don't have...fun.
And our people?
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
Yes... that looks like them.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
A ship,
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They're powering their forward weapons array.
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Why don't you try sitting up?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I told you, there's no --
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Cochrane?
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
We've lost Bridge control!
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Good luck, Captain.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
I didn't mean this future.
Still think we're finished?
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
I was nervous -
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Well, I -
Just the size of my head -
Course heading, Captain?
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Thank you, Captain.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Sulu!
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Any progress?
I don't want to.
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Sir?
NO WAY!
A computer canna lie, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
No.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
How long does he have?
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
Not tonight, I have work here.
So... To happy endings.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
He is very observant.
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
Ready, Captain.
Yes.
How can you be sure?
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
No.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Imzadi. This is so good.

Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Sir, we're being hailed.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
I won't do it.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
Strength in numbers?
Report.
You don't trust me.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Looking up at the stars.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
And what of the Enterprise?
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
I am.
Report!
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
This is a mistake.
No -- this is wasting time.
And?
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Benny, there's nothing there.
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Where did you stop last?
Elmo's...
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I just retired.
Marc Shermin.
Gear shift.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Closed?
No gas.
Shit?
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I can't stay on this planet.
Good morning.
They are beautiful.
Yes, they are.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
I will say that we can be friends.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police!!
Help me!!!
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Very beautiful country up here...
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I told you...
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
I wouldn't think so.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Forget it's there.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Sounds good.
Talk to me about costs, here.
What?  Right Here?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
That's not sayin' much.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
I always do.
Charm.
Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
No, you're just trying to get off.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
What is it?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
So that gives you something.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
So the guy's not a sicko.
Why?
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I'm not going.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Right.  That explains it.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Um... he was older.
What does the Manager say?
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
You heard?
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
Not bad, huh?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Who?
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
I'll take it into consideration.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
How long ago?
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
The man knew how to dress.
They're all criminals?
You got a point there.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Don't be too harsh.
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
But why this pattern?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
Yes, sir.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Maybe you should back off.
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[You tell me.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
No.
But why attack an Agent?
How far is Amarillo?
It's over for you.
That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You should call your Grandmother.
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Sorry?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Sorry, it's just that...
Listen. I had a great time.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
How are you doing?
I miss you, Mike.
Why didn't you call?
...the Michelin commercial...
So what's the difference?
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I need the money.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
Kinda.
Oh no?
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
There are so many beautiful women here.
I'm such an asshole.
Well, you're doing so well...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Pause it. 
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
How's it going for you two?
She was cute.
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Wake up, baby.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
It doesn't matter...
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Double down.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's just leave.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
No! Not the camera guy!
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
Michelle went for you, right.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah. You met him once.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Now?
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I'm not hungry yet.
Yeah.
Where the hell was Paulie, why wasn't he with the Don?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
You look terrif on the floor!
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
What is this nonsense?
What was this for?
For bravery.
For killing a man.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Now that the war is over, Enzo, this boy is being repatriated to Italy.  And you see, Godfather...  He...my daughter...they...
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
You tell us about America.
Yes.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
Mike!  The party starting!
That's for you to find out.
Mike!
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
And when they shot me father...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
Michael...
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
Please say it.
Oh Michael.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Until the old man tells me different.
Cut it out.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Is he alive?
He's drowning me!
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Say again?
Your parents met her.
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
I'm prepared to take the blame.
What are you talking about?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I've got plans!
Ripley's plans.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Is he really not here?
Hello Marge!
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Marge? Where are you going?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
I know.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
So -- are you travelling under R?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
And tomorrow?
My God.
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Do you want me to stick around?
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Why lie?
Well that would be even better gossip.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
Of course. What happened to your face?
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
I don't know...
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What kind of people?
The DMZ?
You must be rich.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Oh. Who was that again?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
I bought a couple of tickets.
But... Betsy...
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
What taxi driver?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
That's fine.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Could you see anything?
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Why you hang around with them greasers?
Yeah. From the likes of them.
I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Well, I tried.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Yes.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Physical? Criminal?
So I hear.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Wiz?
Yeah?
Stick with Carla.
Motor oil?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
I believe you.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Whoa.
Do you have the...
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Well, there's got to be a way...
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
No, sir.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I do.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
What's that?
Good to meet you.  Again.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Yes.
Dad, I...
Luke... what time is it?
Zackly.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
You smell gas?
Jesus.
You should watch what you say.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
Cigarette?
Luke didn't smoke.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Well, that's not what they think.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Is there a young Tim?
No.
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
I already have.
Who?
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I think so.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Because she was afraid.
Look.
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
Cathy!
No!
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
Lois!
Good morning.
And the white house?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
It's a surprise, you see.
Where would I get a boat?
What name?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Young woman cut herself.
Yes.
She was selling birds.
I got them all, Mother.
I don't know.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
No.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
He's not home.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What's that?
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Criminal.
Ouch!
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, but...
You are, aren't you?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Like what?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
It was like that yesterday.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie...
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Mitch...
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
Do you have any lovebirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Mr. Gray?
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
What do you mean, Fettes?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
You've no thought of going there?
This is not a woman!
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Afraid of what?
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Toddy hates me.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The heart pumps it.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Yes.
You and I should work together.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
But where did they get those people?
How long after that was the paralysis complete?
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Where are they?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
I was hoping you'd find out.
The strip joint?
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
You lied at my trial.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
Fuck. Me.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
Erin. It's not your fault.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Could say that.
You want me to walk a straight line?
It's not what you think.
About you.
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
You wrote this?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
No -- not at all.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Professor Barnhardt.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Yes, I have!
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Where is that?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
All right.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
We certainly did.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Yes--?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Hello.
No. That's all finished.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
That's right.
Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
He's my brother.
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
We were gonna grab some food.
Where you going?
Leave him alone.
I will, David!
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Are we havin' fun or what?
It was a dream, Star.
No.  Just you.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Okay?
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
But, Mom...
Lucy.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
What's your name?
I'm Michael.
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Too damn dangerous.
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
How you doin', old boy?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Where's the other half?
Torch them!!
What do we do about those three?
What clothes?
Anything?
Would that test have worked?
I guess you're okay.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Ah... no.
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
What happened?
What are you?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Why did they built it?
No...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Created?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
How do you control the Morlocks?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
And why not?
I -- what are you?!
What?
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
A moonstone.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
You wouldn't believe me.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Learning was important?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
You lost someone.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Yes, sir, he --
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
We don't know.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Sir?
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
You sure you know where to find one?
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
How?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
[Beat] What?
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I know.
How long do we have?
You're sure?
They're not.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I don't understand.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Why don't you help me?
How do you know about Eugene?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
Who...who kills me?
I wasn't talking about anything.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
I'll manage.
No!
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Good God.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
Stop.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
So how come you don't have any kids?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It means shut up, Thelma.
Give me the keys.
Did you finish thinking?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
What's wrong with you?
What for?
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Louise?  Where are we?
Just past Boise City.
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
What?!
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Yes, Thelma?
What do you mean?
Thelma, that is not an option.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
You're a good friend.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
What in the hell is it?!
We're fine!  How are you?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
I'm asking you to leave.
He implied it.
Yeah, but he was successful.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Got cash.
Check.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Jesus Christ you're right.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Out getting coffee.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Am I?
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
I work with retards.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
That sounds like fun.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uh-huh.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
No.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Oh my.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
No I'm not.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Good lookin'?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What...?
Oh yeah. Fine.
The prom -- you going?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Ted, are you okay?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Really? I never got a message.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Hm?
Sure.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Trying to be.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Please leave.
Ted...?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
You got what stuck?
What?! No please, sir --
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Ho there.
Oh God.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
Well, I'm not.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Yeah?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
That is correct.
How's my favorite President?
I said his heart, not his attention.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I know, I know...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
A murder. On the reservation.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What's this about?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Tread matches. It's the car.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Bullshit.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
Why should I tell you.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Cuz I'm a skin?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
This Jimmy's?
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Mister Tully.
Do you want a coffee?
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I thought he'd never leave.
No.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Why?
In that order?
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
No.
What do you want?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
That's three.
Looks like a tie.
Well?
Well what?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Well?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Let's hope you're right!
Were upside down!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Ohhh Mother!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is it the plane?
On what?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So's my Johnson.
What?
3000 feet. I'll do it.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Helping him in.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Why?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Then why are you here?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
I know.
Not something they tell dependents.
Would you take me back? Would they?
Over there man.
What do you want?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
So why am I still alive?
Do you expect me to believe you?
But I thought...
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
I'm listening.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
You open it.
Not since you lost him.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Sit down.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
No shit...
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
I want that fucker dead.
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Are you saying she liked it?
I've got a lock!  There!
Who?
Who is she?
Lori...
Do what?
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Clever girl.
Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you?  After all we've been through?
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
Mars.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
I give up.
Blondes.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
Don't be ridiculous.
So you dropped by to apologize?
What can I do?
What reactor?!
You sure about this?
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Knock it off, Burt!
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
You didn't cook breakfast?
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Jeez, look at that guy.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Like hell you are.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
You sure this is where it was?
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
...we had to lick his boots clean.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
We had a description of the suspect.
Right. You're right.
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
But what?
-- What?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Figures.
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
About Chinatown. What went down.
See-cil.
Oh come on, Cecil.
No, s-sir.
Shu Kai Kim.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
-- Every word.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
-- Roger --
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
I'm nearly out.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
An old woman and her grandson.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
And no one found the ring?
Where is the ring?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Call me.
Laura?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Why do you do it, Laura?
What does Bob say?
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
I already made you two tapes.
What? She asked about my father?
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
What the hell is wrong with you?
When he finds out.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
A friend from school.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
No.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
I don't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
I'm fine.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
No further questions.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Say it.
I completely understand...
It's all right, Mickey.
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
Thank you.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
How come you're calling me from...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Hi, Mickey...
What?
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
So what?
What happened, Joey...?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
Yeah. I'm awake.
The 'History'...?
The broad has disappeared...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Dr. Towler...
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
Hey, there - open up!
There's nobody left around here now.
Is that it over there?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
How long was I out?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They'll understand us, all right!
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Yes, but...
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
He was just here!
I want my kid out of here now!
You going away?
Why does God let there be bad things?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Dylan, where's the man?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
You're not crazy, by the way.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Me?  Why me?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Now?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Looks like weather.
Your father?
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
You may not like what you hear.
I haven't forgotten.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
I didn't know sir.
Where's Mom?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
I just can't believe it.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Figured what out?
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
I feel like I got you into this.
No way!
What'd you do?
What are they doing?
I can't go in there.
Yes, sir.
You all right?
Shouldn't we turn away?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Oh, really?
It has nothing to do with him.
Son-of-a-bitch.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
But, they don't speak English.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Swing up, son.
He climbed when he was ready.
No.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
I understand.
And you didn't do anything about it?
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Y'all take American Express?
How old are you?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
This your car?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
You black?
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
You hitched yet?
So, it's back to the islands.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
And you never told nobody about it?
You okay, honey?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
...are followin' him around.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
What's that, honey?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
Yeah.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
How much we got left, honey?
Yeah, I'm here.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
If you say so.
And no AC.
Sailor?
Yeah?
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I mean tomorrow.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Yes.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
You heard right.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Tripp!
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
No. Not yet he isn't.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Tripp.
Tripp?!
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
What's to tell?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
So modest.
Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Find the jacket.
So whose car is it?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Excuse me?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
No. There's no one here.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Who's got a gun?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Boy or girl?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
No! What gave you that idea?
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
A little.
They're glass. The buttons.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
You?
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
That's a big book you're writing.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Outside Scranton.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Kinship. And what's here?
Maybe she didn't come here.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
You're lying.
I'm sorry.
Want a bite?
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
What would you call them then?
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
Hey.
I got the message you called.
I'm sure.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
You heard? How?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
I'm through improvising.
Oh?
I told Walter.
Who's he barking at now?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
It's Grady, Walter.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
No, the dog.
You doing okay?
Foreman now.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
What does that mean?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
I don't know.
No.
What's with the boxes?
Yes.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
But you are taking it?
People have the right to know.
Are you sure?
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
I know because... it's just something I know.
Yes?
No.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Bad idea.
Try it.
You have no feelings for your niece?
Do you think you're crazy?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
I don't know.
What did you think would happen?
Don't ever do that again.
What?
It's been a while since...
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Look, you can go now.
It's not what you think.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Nothing. It's over.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I got poked around... here and there.
Not ever?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Sneak up behind me like that.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Wasn't up to me.
You wanna know what I think?
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
What about O-2?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
He's got the shakes?
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
He's jammed the mechanism.
Alright, put this on.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Yuh?
Y'all could be more specific.
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We use it if we need to go really deep.
Stand by on the ROV.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
This one is gorgeous.
Four or five days.
Used to what?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Have you decided?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
And what about you?
Does it please you to say such things?
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
And why did you drop them?
What are you saying?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Who are you talking to?
There too...
And what are we going to do now?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
You men are all so dreadful!
Don't worry, we've got everything.
They didn't seem too good.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
You really must do me this one favor.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
He talked to you Himself?
Because...
It's a sin to be fat.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Oh my dear child.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
You've got to eat something Agnes.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them holy.
No.
What do you mean?
I don't know... I don't know...
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
I don't know.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Well, who in particular?
Do you think he loves you?
Why should they?
Down... there.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Then let's talk about something else...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Why not?
You liked Sister Paul?
What else did she tell you?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
No.
Why not?
Not my fault.
I'm not sick.
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
She's dead isn't she?
How?
She watches... she listens.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Are you pretty?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
And why am I here?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
It came out of me.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
And then what happened?
Someone's following me.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you feel?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Him.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
All I want is one more week.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
How do you survive?
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
You were a smoker?
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Could there have been anyone else?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
It's possible isn't it?
And what happened?
Not simple, no.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh God, if only I'd known.
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
An unhappy woman...
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Long, thin and filtered.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
Who is he?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
She is an innocent.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Was it you?
And the baby.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
That's enough.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Just you?
Oh, it's all right.
Yeah?
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
I see you go to the night court.
We're nearly there, sir.
I'll have a bash.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Have I said something amiss?
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
A butcher?
Gerron.
Did you look in here?
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Sorry.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Is it ... is it, really?
I see.  Do you like the play?
They ought to be.
What are you?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Pity.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Yeah ... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Me!
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Is that yours?
What are you doing there?
Give 'em a pull.
What's he know?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Is it? Is it really?
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
... I don't know...
Yeah.  Two hours.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Breathe deeply.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
It grows on you.
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Yes.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
I've completely lost their signal.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
Receiving.
What is it?
It's stopped?
And what do we do when we find it?
Okay.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Let's hear it.
What the hell happened?
Good!  Moisture content?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Engaged.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Thanks.
And?
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
It's too late!
What?
Wait.  Lost it.
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
They've changed their heading again.
Okay, we're in business.
Six month stint on Datus.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
I've found Ackland!
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Jesus.
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
How do you know my name?
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
That's right.
Yes. I do.
Eddie...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Champion to champion.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
What of it?
Because I don't want to.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
We have that in common.
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
How nice.
You've already met.
Nothing?
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
I'll check with Eve...
She's a girl of so many interests.
Twenty minutes!
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes you frighten me.
Don't mix your metaphors.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Here we go...
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Paranoiac!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
Hear, hear...
I understand she is now the understudy in there.
You know what I'm going to be?
With the paper to prove it.
Hello, what's your name?
Why you have to go out there.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Also Addison deWitt.
Everything.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Hmm?
She works hard.
You all put together?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
You were just looking around...
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
She's got to meet you-
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I think she would cheer.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
May I have your coat?
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Let's not get over-dramatic.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
But the raves about your performance-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
She knows enough not to be here.
There are other plays...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Ain't it the truth?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It doesn't matter.
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
What about Bill?
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Coming?
Margo, again...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Where'd you get all that information?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
Yeah?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
July of '71.
Facts or theory?
Who'd you vote for?
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--we gotta top the Times--
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Night.
--Teddy Kennedy?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I've got a lot of energy.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Give me your checkbook then.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
One minute but then--
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
My big civil rights buddy--  --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming.  What're you onto?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
--I saw him. He verifies.
I got Clawsen on hold--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
They are not my clients.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
When so ordered.
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I'll do it.
Thanks coach.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
This is your plan, Finch?
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
I wasn't making fun of you.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
What's that?
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Yeah right.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
You mean...and orgasm?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Are you kidding?  No.
Like a bet?
Hey, minuteman.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad!!
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
This'll do.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
This was remade?  Into what?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Jim...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
No, not again.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
Hey...
You comfortable?
Yeah, are you?
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Sure. I can follow that.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
This looks familiar...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
I know. He told me.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
Whoa...
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Andy...
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
Where is it! Please!
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
What've you got?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Merde.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
How to read.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I have to go now, before it gets light.
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Nervous?
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
I'm so scared...
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Do you remember this?
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
I cursed then all!
It's her.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
What do you want?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Promise me she'll have her home.
Come on.
Singer!
You're like New York. You're an island.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
Yeah, my grammy.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Well...
I'll see yuh.
Neat, yeah.
I know.
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
M'hm.
Look, look at that guy.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
What are you doing?
Uh-uh-why?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Are yuh?
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
What's- It's me, open up.
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Very big spider.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Oh, I had the radio on.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
God.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
What?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Oh, Alvy, come on.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
What'd I do?
I can't.
Tsch, a few.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
I mean that as a compliment.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Charlie Chaplin.
May I see your license, please?
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
You like this house, Max?
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
...of possibly working together.
It was a wonderful set.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
So who won?
Why didn't you come in?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Absolutely.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
She already has.
You don't have any clothes on.
Why didn't you bring him?
Didn't I say?
I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I'd say it was down.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Never.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big hard hero?
A perfect night.
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
I adore him.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Yes.
No luck.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
She left the fucking gate open.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
I don't look my age, Joe.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Yes.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Happy anniversary.
It's a Calder.
I know.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Not long.
Ours.
Oh.  You're serious.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Very well put.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
That's a lot of those.
That's very nice.
I like you.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Excuse me?
What?
We could hardly say no.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Not at all.
Do you need anything else?
Oh?
The Shostakovich.
Really??
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Are you lovesick?
Will champagne help?
You see, that's worse.
We're just feeling our way back.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thanks.
What did I do?
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
And here they are!
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Why are you doing this?
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
You're right!
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
I order you to find out where we are!
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Yes?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
So...you two are in love?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
My mother.
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
What did I tell you?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Good night.
No.
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Oh.
I forgive you.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Here. How about some breakfast?
And where are you now?
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
What for?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
I just want some fresh air.
Who'd care?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Over a girl?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
You usually eat alone?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
The dishes?
I don't?
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
I guess so.
Are you all right?
You do?
That's right, Baxter.
Sir?
How would you like to go tonight?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
I know how it is.
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
On account of me.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
What do you want?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
How many pills were in that bottle?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
No.
Family?
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Good night.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
What do you think?
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Yeah, we better.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
Lovely. You were a big help.
We need all our fuel anyway.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Sometimes.
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Arch light.
Why they call you that?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Get in there !
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
What do you want ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
What -- happened here.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
What's your name, sailor ?
What, sir?
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
I met him.
Fucking savages.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Were you with him, when...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
You hear it again?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
The other one --
You're Australian?
Right now -- I am.
215  CONTINUED:
212  CONTINUED:
Had?
Oh.
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Be careful, okay?
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Told you I'm fine!
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
You don't care enough about Sam to --
I'm too old for this shit.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
How was it talking to him?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Do you love me?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
I know. He's just the best.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
Note. Put it in the note.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
I'm not kidding.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Nice of you... thank you.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
It's one idea...
Okay to say something now?
Okay. Good-bye.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Actually, I don't think so.
Is he dead yet?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Thanks.
Melvin...
You consider your life easy.
Because...  ... you love her?
Why?  What happened?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What are you doing?
What?
You can't --
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Why don't you tell me.
Hi.  Up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  We're not sure which hotel we're at, so could you just follow them?
Where have you been, Robert?
Who?
How did he know?
Um, five.
Twenty large?  That's all?
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
Why?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why not?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
They become complicated... messy.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
About?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
What?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he want?
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.
They're worth less points.
I went into their room this afternoon.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Jesus, if someone had --
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
What are you doing?
Why?  I don't know.
I didn't want to complicate the situation.
She was taken.
Hi.  Did you call --
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Average.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Can I ask you something?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
American currency.
This will take some time.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
What's that? Free!
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
What did the beer cost?
Fifteen crowns.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Well, don't get carried away.
No....The Asylum!
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
And a tram hit you?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
A fine specimen for conversion.
What are you on about?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
I don't want to ruin your day.
What happened?
Now you're using that word.
So?
And if you're wrong.
Siberia.
What do you want me to do?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Yeah, no problem.
You don't understand, I can't!
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
Yeah, pretty well.
So am I.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No way Doug, I can't.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Yep, it's all yours.
They'll do it.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Great....How long will it go for?
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
How?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Seems a shame!
A champion of lost causes huh?
Is it dry?
Who you saving the dishes for?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
No!
What is it you want?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
That's my bag.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Why are there still such headlines?
What are you an idiot!
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
I'm sorry about how we --
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Hypotheticals --
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
Who are you?
This play -- ?
What the -- ?!
I'm an enemy?
So what else is on this list?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Because I try to be nice to people?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
You're really into God, right?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
You don't believe in anything?
He doesn't trust you.
He okay?
All of it.
You don't know what you want --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Help me live until I die?
It's gone now.
Can I -- go out?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
What's Landon Carter up to?
I'm asking how much.
So talk to us about something.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
You're marrying again.
I'm no dummy.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
A similar triangle?
I beg your pardon?
Uh, yes, sir...
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Learn anything?
And where am I gonna be?
Why what?
Your line, George!
Not a holocaust --
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
Operator, what's today's date?
Pro, the sun's out!
So what? We'd be rich!
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Hi. where's Cato?
What's going on?
How you doing, Cato?
What you been doing?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
What'd they look like?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Tom...
Thanks.
Hi.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Doing what?
Well, stop the world.
I know.
What a nice place.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Look at all this junk.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Just thinking.
Hi.
Think I'll take the juice?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
You okay?
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Where're you goin'?
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
You.  Like the papers all say.
She was killed, Penny.
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
John Whorfin will kill us!
What's his problem?
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
Let him go.
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
Hah!
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
How d'ya like your room!
Chet!
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
...Huh? No, I'm 
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
A souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I don't understand-
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
...This must be boring you.
I hope these are your shoes.
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
...Your room does that too?
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
Fink.
Mr. Lipnik.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
Must be.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Excellent picture.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
What are you doing here?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
I don't need any help.
Were you with him last night?
Was there anyone with you last night?
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
Because you didn't love him --
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Don't get too cocky.
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
No.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
What did you think?
You're in over your head.
No.
What did he say?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
No.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I'm writing a book.
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
You have the right to an attorney.
You workin' on another book?
It teaches you to lie.
How's that?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope, can't say that I do.
Thanks.
No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
You think I --
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Catherine says you don't like her.
Why not?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
I'm going with you.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
What was the motive?
Keep your three o'clock.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
No. Should I have?
Not sure. How was yours?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
I think it's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Ignorant art?
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Ouch..
Piss painting?
Decipher?
Yes. What do they... stand for?
Yes, but as a black painter 
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Who am I?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
What's wrong with me?
Don't you think he's using you?
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
Some of them.
OK! Goodbye!
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I will relay the message.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
How could you?  I'm a woman...
What're you really after?
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Y'mean frame him?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
You buy this "blurry" business?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Too late for what, dear child?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I am as well as can be expected.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
What seems to be the problem?
Pheromones?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
What exactly are you doing?
Watch the first step.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Umm-hmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I see you knew him.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
What?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Then you never loved me?
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
How about, MR. E.
Up here, Al.
You are direct, aren't you?
Mr...?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
So glad you could come.
Nostrovia.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
I don't-.
Okay. I'm outta here.
Absolutely not.
You can't-.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
Chase?
Who is it?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Yes?
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Take me. Let the boy go.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
Do you sail?
No.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
I missed you, Lieutenant.
What are you talking about?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
And you want a --
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
No.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
You are on drugs.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Alexander... I know you.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Allie, he's not.
Yeeees?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
It's the last thing we need.
Sort of half.....
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
And a car.
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Doctor Jacobson?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
This sucks.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
And Boot-Head.
Ow! These chips suck.
Damn, huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Uh... I think you scared them off.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Really? That's where we're from.
We're rich in what really matters.
She's ready.
That's how long you were gone.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
They make gypsies look good.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Nobody else can.
So can I?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
Tell the truth.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Where'd they go?
Beetle!
Just <u>say</u> it.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Viridian?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Attic space.
Maybe Charles does.
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes, sir.
Yes. I am.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
He does...?
Hello, Eve.
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Chauncey...
Hello, Eve.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I see.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes, it is very good!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
I see, Ben.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
... Then you really are a gardener?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... I see.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
Yes.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
I live here.
... How long have you been living here?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Yes, I will.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Nothing.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
It's that gardener!
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Thank you, Colonel.
Yes, I did.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
What?
Is the trial date set?
We have to make it an early night.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
Hi.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I want to try.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
Suck my dick!
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
You came up here looking for the portal?
I am a trained performer.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Moving story.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
No, really.
Why not?
My tits?
You're a fag or a liar.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You're evil, Maxine.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Hello. Wendy.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
You can be John Malkovich.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Yes, my dear?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Anybody else?
Oh, be still my heart.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Yes?
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Ya think?
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
I know Denver.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Aw, no, Ella.
You was friends.
I run him off.
He knew Baby Suggs?
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
You shaved.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
Her life is in your hands.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
NUSSING!
Can we just rent it from you?
What's this?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What the fuck is he talking about?
They were Nazis, Dude?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
Nancy's pretty good.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
Huh?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I was talking about my rug.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Dieter Hauff?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Finder's fee?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Well...no, of course not--
This was, uh--
No, but--
Huh?
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
Dude--
Yeah.
Uh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
You know this!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Uh-huh.
Walter--
Employed?
Is this a--what day is this?
Well we--I don't--
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
I said out.  Now.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
Where to first?
What was that?
Recognize him?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
What do you want me to do?
Did you think I wouldn't?
So you're going to do this?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
We're locked in.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
Going somewhere?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
Like what?
What am I injecting you with?
Is he sick?
Any progress?
No --
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't believe that.
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Yes.
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
I don't know. Nightmare.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
The, uh, blur there.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Does it hurt?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
Can't you like just divine it?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
So lemme see it.
Never would've guessed.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
--Cotter: shut up.
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Asleep--
Spite.
Just let it go, I've got you!
What?
What is all this shit?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Pointless.
What?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
For a blur?
Jesus.
You gonna be alright?
Heather.
Yeah.
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Domini.
I can't do it!
Why?
....Ma'am?
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
No, I--
You wouldn't be putting me out.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
...You know that car?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
...Anything else?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
Got a job for you.
...There's a big--
Ya catch any fish?
You said the usual--
Right. Sorry.
To your health, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
Look at these. What are these?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Do you like talk like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Then don't talk about killing.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
Come in.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank-
What do you want to do?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
What happened to him?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Are you sure?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
He got a little jealous.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You want to go talk to him?
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
You want to dance?
Are you feeling okay?
That sounds great!
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
What can I do for you guys?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
I heard.
You?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Allo?
George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
In how long?  A week?
Surprised to see me?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Actually, it was three.
Yes.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Power?
Yeah.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Just low.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Not mad.
No.
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Figured what out?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Jesus Christ.
Pablo said no?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
I said, I've seen it before.
Where are you going?
What?
Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
I swear.  On my life.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
Nice weed, huh?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
What "group"?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Where's Kader?
No ...
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Why?
Are you ready, colonel?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Why?
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
I think I'm going to make your day.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes.
Objection, Your Honor.
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Intense.
I had bypass surgery.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
We stopped seeing each other.
-- And what did you suggest?
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
What did you prescribe for her?
Chinese peony root.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
No.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
You know I can't talk about that.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Hi, Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
You lied to me!
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Michael -- get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
The witness will answer the question.
I can back it up.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Humped
I don't know.
Yes.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
We were here two Christmases ago.
I don't mind waiting.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
They got heat in Michigan.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Francesca.
Lemon?
Clean?
Help cook?
You ought to write these stories down.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
You drink bug repellent?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
I told you, I love other people.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
I would love to come for dinner.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
Nobody's asking you to.
But you don't mind.
I can't do this, honey.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
How do you know what I experience?
Stop it!
WHY?
For who?
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
I'm positive.
Franny?
What happened?
They're not going to find her!
You people really don't like dogs.
Just some flies.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Just try it.
Sorry, my brother.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
And what's that?
All the more reason I should be here.
Are they on the radio?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
The dead get out?
I can't find you.
We gotta jump!
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
Did you do it?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
No way man...
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
But --
You boys been hitting the pipe?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Why not?  He eats everything else.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
I didn't expect --
It's impossible!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Fuck.
What are you doing?
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
I had to.  You made me.
We were in a car accident --
Lick me.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
See?  We're for real.
I guessed you were straight black.
Truck.
Truck.  Of course.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Thanks.
Okay, one drink.
Curious, maybe.
Maybe.
...  I needed that.
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
Basically.
Almost five years.
The redistribution of wealth?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Even though he knew about you?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
What?
Any bodyguards?
There is no going back.
Thank you.
Pop?
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
You're asking me a direct question?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
I won't ask again.
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
So now you know.
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
MPG Capital.
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Yes, I'm here...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
...I understand...
That's what I'm saying.
I can't believe I slept.
I don't remember any of this.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

You have ID?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
So get the hell out of here.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Where's the dog?
My husband's out looking for him.
Get in the basement.
What?
What the hell're you talking about?
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You drink rum?
...Be back.
...your ducts?
You telephone, sir.
Machines don't fix themselves.
What have you got there?
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? You mean you've got ...
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
You are late.
Ah ...
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
What has Tuttle done?
What's she done?
Tell me about Layton.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
If you say so.
I bet you'd like to touch them?
Are you alright?
Ow! That hurt!
Don't litter my cab!
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Who will?
You're joking.
Shit! The house is on fire!
"And your children all gone."
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
He is dead.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
This isn't rare!
My husband's dead, isn't he?
What have you done with his body?
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
I don't know which numero.
Sign here please.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Ha!!
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
Pregnant.
In that time, you ever have sex?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
No way, man.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
You never know.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I need to sit down a minute.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I think the worst is over.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
I'll drink to that.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
These are hard times, Tom.
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
What?
Don't push it, Larry.
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
They'll just keep calling.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Wait.
It's not loaded.
No.  No.
No.  Don't worry about it.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
That's your full name?
Which would you prefer?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Then it went well.
I lost six pounds...
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
This isn't friendship.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Ready.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Goodbye, Paul.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
Jane?
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Should I...
No...no.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
You don't have to finish tonight.
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
Hey?
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
No.  Were you going to you?
Oh, good.
It's incredible who's here.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Don't you work here?
I already told you I'm not.
Whaddya mean?
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Where where...
Thank you.
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...there's...
Here you go, enjoy.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Nothing...nothing at all.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I wonder what his deal is.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Well...
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
What do you have in the box?
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Well I'm overjoyed.
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
Hi.
T-turned on?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Let's move out!
Booo!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Buffy, honey?
Maybe.
What's Bobby gonna say?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
What'd you dream about?
Nothing.
I do?  I guess I do.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Like what?
) What do you think?
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
You look way pretty, Kim.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
To bring you... your birthright.
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
I was a slave.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Meet me at this address after school.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
They were vampires?
You are such a wet.
Watchers?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
It isn't important.
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
I was just scared is all.
I don't get it.
Thanks.
I don't understand.
You think so?
Got that.
I never thought of that.
Cool!
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
They'll kill us!
The homelesses?
Except for Prom.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
I don't think so.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
I'm yours.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
Get over here.
How 'bout a back rub?
Yes I do...
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
It's Skip, for you.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Crash, I didn't think you--
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I doubt that.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
I got released.
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
What's it say?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You a God damn witch?
Don't bump me.
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
I thought I was--
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
You been in the Majors?
I was playing naked.
I was great, eh?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I'd kill ya.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
He walked eighteen?!
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
I'm a little in shock, quite frankly...
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
No, of course not.
You mean, I have your permission?
What?
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
In other words, I'm fucked.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Hey, she came to talk...
She came to talk to me...
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
How'd you know I was here?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
Hello.
What can I do?
Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
We can't get rid of him?
Why not make them happy?
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
You all right?
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Want to go? Let's go back in.
It's chinchilla.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
No, he didn't.
What? What?!
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...under?
How serious?
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Get off of me! Stop it!
The arrangement is over!
Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
What'd you have?
She had the same.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I wouldn't -
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
All right, I will, I will.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
...worst possible time for me.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
No, Sir.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You just - Just stop him.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Leave me alone!
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He's gone?
He's not here?
Of course, Remo.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
No problem.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Okay.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Let me think about that.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Nicky, please...
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
You fucked with me for the last time!
Great.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
You are.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
...all the luck in the world.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
Listen...
Yes, don't worry.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
Mm-hm.
Well, how come I laid nine?
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Yes, uh...
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
You're probably right.
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Car wash, Captain?
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
How much?
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Don't sneak up on me...
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Who's on the phone?
I didn't hurt you.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
And stop with the directions.
Any minute.
Lady, try making some sense.
I don't believe you.
My name is --
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Please.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
What do you do for a living?
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Are you okay?
You're all three of you in that van?
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
They put their hands all over me.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
You, I would've noticed.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm handling it.
Both hands on your lap.
Took preparation.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
I don't want it.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
It's your call.
I don't know what you mean.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And not a nickel.
Count it.
Yeah?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
How do you know?
Where's the backpack?
There's no lady here.
Did I?
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
In a way.
Scottish?
Jimmy.
Not me.
What was that?
You on the game?
He's getting up.
How different?
Shouldn't I go?
Maybe.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
You could?
When?
Don't.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
Yes.
Afraid so.
You said anything, Dil
What pills?
You knew my Jody?
Got to be somewhere.
I like you, Dil --
It's my name, Dil --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
I promise.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
Tough work, that.
He's hot.
I know.
Leave her out of this.
She's nobody. She likes me.
Jude?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
And do you know why?
What?
He's at home.
Definitely unusual.
Eat something, would you?
What do you mean you can't?
So, what do I look like?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What is it now?
And you know the funny thing?
She'd be anyone's type.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Absolutely not.
You make a nice couple.
You could have said no.
Why did you sign up?
Shouldn't take it personally.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Is it bad?
See if she's all right.
Go to sleep now.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Yeah?
Why?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Come and get me, soldier --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You're crazy --
All right -- where's the letter?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
You don't look so bad in this light.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Oh.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No.
Barely, yes.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
How long do you intend -- ?
Sorry about that.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Does it hurt?
You can't.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
I'm not fifteen.
There, you said it.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
The phone's ringing --
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Maybe.
What -- like Scobie?
No sense messing up the streets.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
Fiction or non-fiction?
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you want?
Yes.
Leave?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I don't understand.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Doing what?
Instant divorce you mean?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I believe what he said.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Yes?
Please stop -- please!
He knows everything.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
What is it about?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
I get all your CDs.
One more time.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So?
Daddy you scared me!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
What's wrong?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
No honey.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
I know where you're going.
Who's?
You gave me a 'D'.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Then you should go.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Oh nice save.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
Why?
I got to get home.
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
Go to the police station!
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
Where's Sam?
You want cash?
I got, uh....
I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.

...all the time.
Am I missing somethin' here?
Borrowed.
Hey.

...work!  It's not even load-...
...I believe in live and...
 
Holy shit...
Oh, shit.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 

Goddamn!
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on, old...
Come on.
Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
No.  Shit.
These'll keep it cold.
 Aw, shit  
All right, let's go.

 Listen!  Listen...

Uh-oh.
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Worth a try.
A-And you  owe me...
...man.


Hang...
Come on.  Come on.

 Vitelli! Vitelli!

What'd you come back for?!
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
You, Arlo.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
 Yeah.
Thank you.
Be cool.  Be--
What'd he say?
Listen, shithead!
I urge you to be persuasive.
Well, well, well.

He's the dude...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...owe you.
Exactly.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
You have my word on that.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Mm-hm.
Pleasant surprise.
I can't say it's a surprise.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
Radio the bikes.

Right.  Tim Mason.
 But...
Is this your establishment?
Iced coffee.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
Not tonight...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...-spite the mouth.


No.

...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Geneva just pulled the plug.
No sign of 'em...
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
What's going on, colonel?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...-son.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
He's brains without ambition...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...-to a simple thing like...

...-son.
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
I'll lead 'em out.
You sure?
Get in 

Gimme this god-...
I'll stay here and secure this position.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
'Course you do, Jake.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
If that's what it says.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
It doesn't hurt.
Very.
Honest?
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Avocado groves?
What is it?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
How are you, Lou?
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
What pictures?
What for?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
Looks like you went quite a distance.
You left your keys in the ignition.
I got your check in the mall.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Know him?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
What were you doing there?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Yeah.
And I want to know where.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Aren't you coming back with me?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Where can we go?
Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
Who?
Ida Sessions.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
He never even kids about it.
Only when I breathe.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Well, no.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
No, really?
I'm afraid so.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They were partners.
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Why'd she run away?
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
But you don't have any kids!!!
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
For what?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
My husband...you know him.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
How long's it been shut?
Three cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Enthusiastic?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Are they standing for me?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
We haven't heard from him.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Emily!
Emily, you -
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I intend to find out.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
Toothache.
What's funny now?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
You're very easily amused.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Half past eleven.
At night?
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Do you know what that is?
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Good.
It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Yes.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Maybe you could remember something that -
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
I know, but -
Thompson!
The banks are out of luck, eh?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
What the hell is that?
You're shittin' me.
Jesus!
That's it, everybody out.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
God, isn't he great?
There's no light back there.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
How like her.
He's your fianc.
You're such an asshole.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
I left like an hour ago.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Are you open?
This is the last time I come to this place.
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Shocking abuse of authority.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Great story, isn't it?
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What about Veronica?
All four?
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Can we talk about this later?
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
I know.
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
Sorry.
Design major.
I'm gonna go to her wake.
I can't close the store.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
An embarrassing way to die.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Let me borrow your car.
I want to rent a movie.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
I like to expand my horizons.
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Because I'm here.
What did she say?
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
You didn't have to choke me.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Do I know you?
Oh for God's sake!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
I should start.
We were going to start again, I think.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Meaning?
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
The porno mags?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Hunhh? Nothing.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Typically male point of view.
Twelve.
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
Where?
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Please calm down.
Well...?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
Thank you for the lasagne.
What time do you get finished?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Veronica, I love you...
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
I didn't do that!
He's your cousin?
No way.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
No way!
That's tight. Solid.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
How long you gonna be here?
And... he told you all of this?
He didn't ask me to...
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Bye. 
I don't know.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Surprise me.
What the hell are you doing here?!
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
How're ya feeling?
There you go.
Help me!  I don't want to die!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
I don't expect you to understand.
You couldn't.
A flare up...
Where?
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Gabe!?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
Of course I do.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
Can you see light?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
Never
Thanks for holding on.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What the fuck you mean you burned it?
He'll freeze.
No, he's gone.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Don't use my name!
I don't trust him.
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
Help me, sir?
Who are they, sir?
Hullo.
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Well, shall we get down to it?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
No, sir.
Religion?
No, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
How're you feeling this morning?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Are you referring to the background score?
I just say what the other person would say?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
I've done my best, have I not?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Yeah... Pete the English.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Bottega.
How often you go?
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
What thing?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Oh?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
I got caught up at work.
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
You're kidding me.
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
It's not that kind of job.
What?
Two...
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
What?
Let him go, Vincent.
You mind?  I'm working here.
No.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Doesn't cover everything.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Slow the hell down!
They said send you downstairs.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Are you crazy?!
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Nothing is easy.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
You're certifiable.
Equitation.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Who?
Never heard of him.
Has this happened to you before?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
He's why you punish yourself.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
A water main broke.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
You look great.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
What about them?
My father's house.
I don't understand.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Blue moon...
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I love you, too.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
And you have no idea where he lives?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
I want to believe you, too.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
What gave me away?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
No doubt.
You know why I'm here.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Are you threatening me?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
You...
Thank you?
J39 Z186...?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
I can't move any smaller.
Could we hear to the moon?
So who -- what -- are you?
Many others.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
You live here.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A page-break signal.  A period.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
The V.L.A.?
Greenbank?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Champagne please.
Do you love your parents?
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
You're willing to die for this.
Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
The final countdown.
It was quite a page turner.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Git your shovel and git to work.
But I made this arrangement --
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
She took off with that convertible feller...
What's all this dirt in the yard?
You got your mind right, Luke?
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here's the Patrol.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Borrowin'.
Whatcha got?
Whatta you so happy about?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Ana paira ninas. Koko's the brains.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
I want to die.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
I was?  How you spell that?
I never hurt nobody...
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You already made the delivery?
She's supposed to have it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
In jail.
Who was the man in the basement?
You know where.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Would you want to work with us on this?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
How do you know that?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
We'll show that to...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Maybe you should...
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Tell me what to do!
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
I was.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Absolutely.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
What about her arms?
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
No. But when he's in that car...
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
What is it?
I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus...
You're kidding.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Just go ahead and tell us.
And the party?
Really?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
What's his name, Letty?
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
You too, Mom.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Lie?
You can only do what feels best to you now.
What if it's got a pattern?
A while, I guess.
Very romantic setting.
We'll get caught.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
No way.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Well?
So there were no problems?
So, it's over?
Hey.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
What is it? Are you OK?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
Well then why'd it happen?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I love you so much.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
You can get out of the dinner.
Can you loan me a 20?
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
No, no.
No...
It doesn't matter who.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I'm glad you're doing well.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
What are you doing?
A pass.
They don't have a murder weapon?
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on is phone?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
C'mon, Laurant, America?
I only have your word for that.
For what?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can't.
Why not just steal another one?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
What hotel?
I was told to take what we have and go.
Yes.
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Going somewhere?
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
How's my brother?
What happened?
They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Who are you?
Then leave her to me.
Where's your master?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
This spells trouble.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
How so?
You say she killed a policeman?
I'll give them to you.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Never!
Let's stop a moment.
Give it back!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Give me back my comb.
Let them look.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
No.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
They're gone.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Mister Funboy.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I went to see a friend of mine.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I wish to possess what you have now.
Shelly?
Shut up.
Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
That's right.
Are you okay?
So what year are you going into?
Junior.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Why are you being so dramatic?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
How are you today?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
You don't even know me.
Doing what?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
Wait, don't hang up.
Sure. Have a good night.
Need any company?
I do.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Am I bothering you?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
That's not fair.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Would you like a tour?
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
The football stud?
I don't think that bothered him.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Where did you find those?
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
See that wasn't so bad.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Well do you like him?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
And then I can go home?
You promised to let me kiss you.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Positive.
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Call me later.
What's wrong with you?
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Moving along quite well.
Shut up.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Morning.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You didn't?
Some other time.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Get off me!
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Get out!
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Excuse me.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I love the smell of pine.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What song, dear?
Sometimes.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
Oh, thank you, darling.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Did you hear the child out?
I'm never unfair.
What is it, Alice?
Yes, I did.
Where did you mail them?
Yes, daddy.
But wishes don't come true.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
They ran away.
And who did the voice belong to?
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Daddy!
I've wanted a friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
That's right!
That one's an elm.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You mustn't be afraid.
But she's dead!
You?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Mommy read it to ne.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Hide me? Why?
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Does she have PMS?
No it's mom.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Maybe he's just shy.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Where are all the mediums?
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Charming Carlton.
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
And he was missing an arm.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
Hello?
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Oh come on. Knock it off.
Uh huh. So pee.
You never say that.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Wow.
No?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm sorry.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Goodnight.
Was there anything in that washer?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that how you feel?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Go away. I might hurt you.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
She's just so... pathetic.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
I told you she was innocent.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Not really...
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
You typed this report?
Why are they after you?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Horrible...
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
You understand what you'll be doing?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Dave...
The Washington Post.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
What about her.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Oh.  Excuse me.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
I'll lock him away for good.
Uh-oh...
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Oh my God...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
In the car?
What?
Fine.
`Dave'?
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
The Fidelity nonsense...
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You got a gun?
No.
The Vice-President...
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Oh... Yeah.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
You really believe that?
I missed...
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
Help me get him to the boat.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
The hospital? 
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What you wanna do?
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Women swoon!
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
Well?
So you really think she means you're going with her?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
Oh God, it's over now!
Mr. Keating!
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
I'm not?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
You what?!  How did you do that?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Pleased to meet you.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Are you going with Chet?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Nothing.
A play, dummy.
So?
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Visit from my father.
They are...they are everywhere.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
What are you people talking about?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
That's what I do.
Like cattle...
You're saying they can think?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
Why don't you back off?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Maybe plans changed...
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
Here's to huntin'.
They did too!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Who? Who is?
You don't!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
I came to see Merle.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Oh, well...
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Where's it gone?
You Biederman?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Frost.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
What are you doing?
You're going hunting?
Up north.
Playing?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
So do I.
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
What are you, hoping?
What do you think?
Forget Sal.
Watch it, shithead!
Where's Vince?
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Right.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
What?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
I want to stop aging.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
We have to talk.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
You sure?  I can help you.
I drive.
But Sergeant...
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Hey, I'm eating.
Wanna try?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
...What are you talking about...?
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
I just heard.
No.  I want to be with you.
Jabez! Careful --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
It hasn't opened yet?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
Anybody can see that.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Grandma, look at me!
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
You are afraid!
-- of what happens after we die!
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Coming along, Jabez?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Why not -- ?
How much?
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Not all of it?
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Jabez -- Jabez!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
What's ailing that dog?
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
What's that?
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
Why don't you?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
The code key, please...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
I'm a cop from New York.
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
Three down, four to go --
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Is that him?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Aw, hey...
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
It looks like a whole roast.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Ooohh....
You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
They won't talk to you.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
What kind of things, Leon?
I'm afraid.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
Yeah.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Okay, give us the women.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
The girl hostages.
You tryin' to fuck me?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
I must of been outta my mind.
Where's the back door?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Sure - we like you.
Would I hire you?
You got Bank Americard?
What now, Sonny?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
It's the cops.  Shit!
I want him to think that.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
Newsman, not ...
Morning.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
What?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Yes.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
Cool it, Choco.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
Uhhh... I have no idea what you just said.
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Where is Domino?
Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
And?
How much?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
I'm coming.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
You are too crude.
WAKE UP!
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Sweet Dick Willie.
It's dug.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Depends.
Can't do.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Whatdafuck do you want?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
No.  What are you gonna do?
When?
Tina, you are too slick.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You deaf or what?
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I just got here.  You sweep.  I betcha Sal asked you first anyhow.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
Whaddup.  Money?
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I'm listening.
I love you, my brother.
Sez who?
Since when do you know what's best for us?
I didn't think so.
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
HARRY!
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Excuse me?
Yeah...
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Mom, you know that never works.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Just a guy I hang out with.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Whoa. What was that?
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
You're not my real dad.
You take that back!
Welcome to public school, my friend.
How do you know it's for us?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I kinda screwed things up.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
But-
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
You certainly did.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
The one on the left.
I thought I told you to get lost.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, what?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
What?
Me too. I'm almost there.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
How was that?
Obviously.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Who's there?
Oh, just like the President.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
You know the ancient tongues?
Your Reverence.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Where are we do you think?
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
What's in the box?
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Where?
... Many men have tried.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Why were you buying a coffin?
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
But you're a big star!
I never thought of that.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
You'll be sitting on the right.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Don't you have any savings?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Sorry...
Last night was quite a romp.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Isn't he?
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
I kinda need it now.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Hruphh...?
Raising money is tough.
Yes?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
So you're not a fruit?
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
Um, I guess --
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Hello.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
No! I love sex with girls.
Well you tried --
The poor girl's out of a job.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
I'm really sorry...
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
You're <u>sure</u>???
What octopus motor?
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Who?
What?!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
So?
What?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Ed --
I don't think so.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!
Eddie...
St. Joseph's.
What happened?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Why do it?
Right.
It's... okay
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Um...
I really like you too...
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I need to talk.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
It's not their fault.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Everybody's someone.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
What did you do to your hair?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Yeah?!
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Please!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
That girl's an idiot.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Ed?
We don't have foibles.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
But you haven't written your novel.
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
Thanks for everything.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
Yes?
So Tracy?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
I did it.
And when did you do it?
This weekend.
And how did you get in the school?
Which door?
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Here?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Hey Yeah?
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
People can see this.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You dumbshit!
How's the left these days?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
But you did it anyway.
Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
So tell me about it.
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
How what, Wendell?
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
You expecting problems?
At least not anymore.
Thanks, but no thanks.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
I... No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
What are you going to do?
Lynn Bracken.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
How was I?
You, me and White, huh?
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Sid, how are they hanging?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
Have we met before?
Was it a party?
I'm doing a transfer now.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Yes.
Who was that other guy?
Wait.
I'll pay you.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Why'd you leave?
What do you think?
They're here.
Think we let out enough air?
Drive.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
With what?
I know, but--
Your stuff?
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
You tell me.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No, sir.
Right.
Yeah.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Sorry.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
It's really over?
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
DePinto?
It's how he works.
Rachel--
You have to.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
He didn't.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
She can't talk to you right now.
In your dreams.
Who won the fight?
The blender?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Jesus.
I don't know!
Yeah?
I need help.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
What is it you want?
Why not?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
The originals?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Sir--
If they've looked at the video.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Now is that clear?
Excuse me?
He said - be careful.
You sing.  All the time.
What's this?
I'd like you to have them.
What am I looking at?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
I can still taste you.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
What?
Don't do this.
Don't talk.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
A broken car?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Her hands and feet were tied.
Which we've overflown twice.
What's the matter with you?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
I told you so.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
David Caravaggio.
I don't know.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
You were in Africa?
So was my Patient.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Who are his ghosts?
She can take you as far as Florence.
Irving Berlin.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
I can already see.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's Canadian.
I've been told that before.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
He's sleeping.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I was looking forward to this evening.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
How awful.  What will you do?
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
Through a window.
You ordering chop suey again?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
I can't?
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I didn't expect you to be so...
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
I know.
But Roki said--
We're going to die, aren't we...
You stole my luggage? You--
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
What's my problem? You want a list?
And good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
On what? Another job?
I didn't mean to get personal.
Got it.
Thank you.
And--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Okay, you're a thief.
We're living history here.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Pulse detectors.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
The sign of our partnership.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
Put this on!
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Gin, really.
Which is--
In the van.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
Because I never assume anything.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
You're giving them to me?
Thought you had to use some of these.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What's she doing here?
There's more than one?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
For what?
And get someone to help around the house.
Out to lunch with the girls.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
She insulted me!
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
And, what, I'm not serious?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
I don't know what to say.
I wasn't gonna --
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Whose number do you need?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Why not?
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Great.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
About this.
What's that?
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Have you been logging on?
What?
Who's Baxter?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks at Han.
Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Because of my father, I guess.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Our destruction?  Who?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
I think we're in trouble.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Yes, Your Highness?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
We've got to get out of this shower.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Hyperdrive.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Thanks.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Closer?!
A tremor!
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
I have followed my feelings.
I feel cold.
My mind fills with so many images.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Nobody's going to believe it.
Believe what?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I tried...
Where is he?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
You told me he was dead.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
What's the little black box do?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
A medical team will be standing by.
Where'd they go?
No way.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
Don't follow me.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Perceval, you have returned!
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
There is one.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
I see, your excellency.
It's-
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
What did the doctor say?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Would you like some more coffee?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
She used those words?
Please go away.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Yes am.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Have you told him what's happening?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Yeah.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
I don't know
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
What's playing.
Where's Regan?
Bon Jour.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Okay
No.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
I've seen him.
Unlikely.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
That's to bad.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
How old are you?
Who is it?
You're not going to drive!
Twelve years.
Well, look at this.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Go fuck yourself.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Count it.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
Nice, huh?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
What's that?
Let's get it over with.
I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
I'll drop the eighths.
Oh, brother.
Make it collect.
Just a lucky guess.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Right.
Good idea.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Expensive hangover.
They were simple songs.
He was just having fun.
No.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Right.
Go ahead.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
She asked for it.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Well, that's fine --
My watch is broken, too.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Don't take it personally.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
When?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
What's wrong with it?
A seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine!
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Right.
Fucking.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Maybe it's legit.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Great.
Peggy Lee?
What'd she sing?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
How come?
Funny hours.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Frank works hard.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Every year.
It's okay.  Last one.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Soap convention.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Hi.
Let me get the light.
Losing his teeth.
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
How do you know?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
John.  It's good to see you.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Drive.
Hey, bro ...
So?
What do you mean?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
I'm late for surgery.
So you had a nightmare.
How did he expect to do that?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Stay away from my family!
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
-- what?
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Back then -- who wasn't?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
They did a pretty good job.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Trouble at work?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
She said that?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
No.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hello!
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
Do what?
I think it worked out okay, dont you?
Our life in a nutshell...
You want the cake!?
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Not it...?
Youre so...beautiful...
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Mrs. Peterson.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
What the --!
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Reed? ... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
What did you wish for, honey?
I'm worried about you.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
What?
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What's going on?
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
I'd hold that off awhile.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Wish I knew why.
General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
You said there was a quick way out!
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
What'd you do that for?
Sort of.
Any reserve air?
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
The Wall's transparent...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Huh?
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Mr. Mohra?
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
but do you know that for sure without -
Yah, but -
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
No, no, fax is -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Yah!
My patience is at an end.
Okay.
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We're good to loan in.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Mm.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
Gustafson's accountant.
- looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
Copy.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yah.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
Yah, I guess.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Well -
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You are a moron.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
This is... really a shock...
You need to lighten up.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
It becomes an addiction.
Look, this is a bad time...
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Here.
Make sure.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Chloe's dead.
Guy or girl?
Answer the question!
What did you say... ?
What... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
What happened... ?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
How have you been?
Who do you think I am?
My suitcase was vibrating?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
What do you do, Tyler?
Thank you.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Insurance'll cover it.
I don't follow...
Yes, you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Go ahead.  Say it.
This is crazy.
Strange.
What?
What are you reading?
Doesn't matter.
I said I promise!
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
We don't need him...
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why did you do that?
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
What about Marla?
You... you can't be serious about this.
I can't let you...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Yes...
One minute.
You need me.
No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What are you doing?
Appreciate something.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
Abort the plan.
No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
How'd you know?
Yesssss...
S-S-Stuff.
Why?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Please, what else could it mean?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Whoa, nine months?
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Fag.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
And don't pass on the right.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
It's a guy in a cage.
Gawd, you look awful.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Why'd they want us?
I know.  I go with you.
John.  My name is John.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Hello, John.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
No really..I can't.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Hello....congratulations.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
What do you think?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Uh... basement I think...
You a friend of Parry's?
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
Which ones?
Now what?
My name is Parry.
I'm the one what?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Parry.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Do you follow her every day?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Are there any questions?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
I advise you to let us go.
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Twinky?
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
I did, didn' I, El?
I'm sorry.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
Who?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Am I on TV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Robert Eroica...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Sorry.
No.
Everybody still up on the Island?
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
It's not that bad.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
What?
What have you been doing since then?
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
If you're free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Thank you.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
No, it isn't what I think.
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No, I can't...
Catherine...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
And what about love?
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
So watcha doin'?
How you treat them?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Where you goin'?
Pitt.
C'mon.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Yeah.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
How do I know you're not lying.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I have no idea.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Nineteen.
Hey you're really nuts.
My God, you're serious.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
Like tonight.
Jesus.
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Nothing. They're still there.
You're in the Records Room.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Oh my God!
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
Sure you did.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
I mean put clothes on.
Lunch...
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
You shouldn't be here.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
No wonder.
I'm her cousin.
Two...
What's the spread on the game tonight?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
Who?
Fletch, you want an apology?
Not really?
Jim Swarthout?
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Make eye contact when you say that.
Let's get serious...
Why are all these people after me?
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
I can't kill this kid's father...
Are you okay?
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
And hey, I appreciate it...
'Booty Time.'
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Shock.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
How's everything?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
There'll be someone else.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
You're in show business.
What?
I got no music!
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Suspicion of what?
You got the warrant?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What is that old building?
I been damn careful up to now.
You remember Mary Finelli?
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
How do we get to the vault door?
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Wish you weren't.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I'm serious.
The future guy?
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Next time lets put some money on it.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
What?
I don't know.
No wait, don't go!
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
I'll warn them.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
I'll be damned.
How?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
He took your wallet?
Longbranch...?
Gordo?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Wife around?
A hot shot, huh?
Going?  How do you mean?
What is that?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Barely.
It's dark down there.
Your bed.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Hi.
Please... be cool.
Yes.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
I just want you to like me.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Why?
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
There...Ya happy?
No.
Why?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Will you listen, dammit!
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Eight times.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
Steven...
I'm here.
Legs giving you trouble?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Hello...
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
It was a community service.
What are you doing?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Are you crazy?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
I mean really never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
No thanks.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Yeah.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
I don't think that's such a safe idea
I...I can't...
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
We must abandon.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
No, we're not.
How do you Eknow.
Had to be him.
Let's work on it.
She's dying.
About what?
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Why won't you tell me your name?
Mystery. Deception.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I'll have whatever she's having.
Who the hell cares?
Great game. Red Sox are winning.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
It's a complicated subject.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
This could be it!
Why do you care?
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
'm not worried about this kid.
Have to hurry back.
Game six is history,pal.
Why?
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
You've worked with Elliot?
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
The fact is, I have to get going.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --
You mean Gandhi?
What was he like?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
A -- a week.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Hm.  Is it?
Do you find me stubborn?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Who's leading them?
Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Surely you know what you have.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
You okay, Jerome?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?
Everybody goes there.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I have your samples ready.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
You didn't know?
Flight got you nervous?
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
What about them?
I'll take care of my end.
Hello, McCoy.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Half a million.
Fatter... some things never change.
I guess I'm kind of...
How was it?
But sometimes I cried a lot too.
For exits off Main Street.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
You sent me to him.
What do we do?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Where are you going?
How much?
We're going to make it.
What is it?
You're crazy.
Where's home?
That certainly makes you kind of special...
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Okay. How many bank exits?
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.
That right?
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Who?
Oh ay?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
Though nicer than most?
Once a week?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Brumby.
I don't know.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
I left last year.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Who's Brumby?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
It's not like that, luv.
Will this do?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Are you awake?
Did you sleep well?
No chance of that.
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Yeah.
Nasty way to go.
All right. Two hundred.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You ever get 'em?
They did.
They did.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
You're on this...
I...
That's right?
Eh...?
For some sales pro...
With River Oaks?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What hard part?
Just the act.
Somebody...
Huh.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Well.  Well...
Did you talk to Graff?
Is that what I said?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
I didn't ask to be.
That's right.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
It's a waste of time.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
You're done, come down, and let's...
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Why?
Can't do it.
No.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Why?
The leads are coming.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
You are?
What are you trying to tell me?
How do you know I made it up?
I don't know what you are saying.
The check's no good?
Shit.
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Eight units?
Shelly...!
"Always be closing..."
You closed 'em today?
...yes...
Glad to meet you.
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
What?
Mm.
Did I...?
I don't understand.
And when was that check cashed?
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
She told me not to talk to you.
And the check is...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You hear what I said?
They got, listen to me...
I have the stuff from last year's...
...you want to go out today...?
...I wouldn't worry about it.
I got lots of presents.
I got surprises for everybody!
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Connie.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
And you believed that story.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
Beautiful.
What?
He's not the same as when I met him.
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Will you tell him?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I want it met.
It might show.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Is he related to the witness?
This committee owes an apology!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
How's the baby?
I had no idea...
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, I told you...
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
I know.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
On the phone?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
The same assurance we got from you.
He supports me.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Fuck you.
Your wife?
Of course.  I am married still.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
What do I do?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
No.  Iced tea's fine.
What did she mean by going flooey?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
Football in college.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
But why?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
I didn't --
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Run for what?
Let's get out of this funk hole
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
Do I have any other choice?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
I never made it to Korea.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
I don't remember that one.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
What was that?
Oh Clayton.
I can undress myself, thank you.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
Should you be drinking in your condition?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Jimmy.  How are you?
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
She is horrible.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
No.  I expect you can't.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
How's that?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
No. That was Higgins ....
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
What does that mean -- ?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I know...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
We'll take it...
Sure -
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
You sure you're okay -- ?
Something like that -
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
The era when crime didn't pay --
You okay -- ?
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Call 911 -
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
So, you seeing anybody?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
Slip it in ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
You okay -- ?
Some crew you got ...
So she flies -
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You know what you got here?
Not --
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Nods again.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
The bag with the envelopes.
I can't do it anymore.
What did he say, exactly?
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
What happened? You okay?
I better call again.
How?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Where'd you find such creeps?
You know what to do?
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
No, no. It's okay.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
I got dry cleaning.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
Oh shit.
Suck my cock!
All right, then.
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
How's the woman?
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
How you doin'?
How'd you know where to find me?
I guess so.
--That isn't funny--
WILL!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
I told you, I just got change.
Some other guy?
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
What class did you say that was?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
No.
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Yes.
Good to see you.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I'll be okay.
You moved?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Who?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--And confuse him--
Why there?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
You've never been out of Boston.
Haven't called her.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
They could see that I meant it.
Do you think you're alone?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
I been there. I played my hand.
Oh, I know.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Which one did you take, Will?
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
What?
Sounds good, where are you now?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
You grew up around here?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
You're *ticklin' me!*
People done it. If they could, we could.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
What'd he look like again?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Four.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Joad. Tom Joad.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
That cut you got?
Crate fell on me.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
Sure do.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
I stay in my own yard.
I didn't mean nothing.
You people got a lotta nerve.
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
How 'bout Granma?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
But will it--hurt the baby?
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
I like the tent better.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Yes'm, that was it.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Ma, you sick?
Look, Ma!
When?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
I ain't full.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
How's it feel, Tommy?
They know he got hit in the face.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
You mean get off my own land?
Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
You people looking for work?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
What do you want to do?
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
That's part of it.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad experiences.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Yes.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Which would you rather...?
No time.
He was trying to kill you, right!
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
I just know.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No harm no foul.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
That's strictly Bader-Meinhof stuff.
It was the PLO.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
One cannot love and kill.
Did you see Blank in there?
All of it?
That's going to cost.
I have scruples. Next.
Don't forget your identity.
You have.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
So what happened to you?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
How's that?
Why not?
This is Annie MacLean.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Five years. My son was born here.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Show me again.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
What?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Well, one was for salad...
About what?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
What did you say?
Started what?
When? Tonight?
Why should they?
Who is it?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What about Grace?
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
You've got to stop doing that?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
May I have a suggestion?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
What do you mean?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
No. He had the choice.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
What was it like?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
You don't seem to upset?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Ha...
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
What does she do?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I know where he goes.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I thought your mom's coming up?
You just showing off for her!
Long enough.
You ever miss it?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
You think it's cool?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
That's far out!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Cereal.
Go fix the phones.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Crash Override.
That's Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
Oh, shit! He got me.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Make it our first date.
Thank you.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
What?
You what?
Why did he come to you?
Alright, so what have we got?
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
We caught 'em.
Mr. Belford?
My name is the Plague.
Die, dickweeds!
What? whatwhatwhat?
Yo, what's up?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Any questions?
A hacker planted the virus.
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Thank you.
Real charmer.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
So?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
What does that mean?
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Why not?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
Jamie!
What are you doing out here alone?
You knew. You just didn't care.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
He can still watch.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I'm scared.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
There was no one outside.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
You're coming with us...
Will you get her for me?
She's washing her clothes.
Thorazin.
What does that mean?
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
...any sister talk?
I love that.  That's my type.
You want to see some?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
That's disgusting!
Uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
But I'm seeing him.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
And it's just in one ear?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Oh, Elliot!
How about you?
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yeah.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Is something wrong?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you in love with someone else?
Are you?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
How do you know?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm...
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
What's the problem?
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh, yes, you have!
Who is it?
Jesus...Jesus!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
How are you?
I'm okay.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Huh?
Ohh!
That's really nice!
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
Okay.
Frederick didn't come with her.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
How?
You're crazy!  That's not true.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter?
My script?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
It was a terrible evening.
I'm okay.
Well...
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Oh.  Oh.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Hi.  How you doin'?
Tch.
Dad...
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
A reward...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
How you doin?
What's new onna street?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Seen what, sir..?
What do you want me to do?
...they're from Baltimore....
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Let the girl go.
Am I on that case, sir...? 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
Waal...
I have had many excellent meals there.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
You're <u>free</u>...
...when I... 
Look what they put her on...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I am on the track of...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I don't <u>think</u> so.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
When?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Hey.
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
What else don't you believe in?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
Don't say that.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
It's not my style, okay?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don't know. Should you?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
S'okay....
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
What is this shit?
It doesn't work on small animals!
Did to.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You can be so immature!
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Is it sleeping, dude?
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
My name is Gina!
You have to let me go!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Fruit.
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I think I'm dying . . .
That.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Yes . . .
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
It's inside a moving car.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Sure plenty of times.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
I have my connections
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Hello I'm Dr...
I've been in here before.
I said she's been missing for-
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Thanks.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Do you know where you are?
Ambulance.
Poor Trevor.
Last week...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
Bill, listen...
He waited for you three hours!
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
You!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Me!
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
Unprofessional.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
I didn't ask him.
How are they with kids?
So this really does the trick, eh?
Where are these toys of yours?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Any particular brand?
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
I'm thirsty.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
He doesn't have a temperature.
Whew.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear that?
Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Oh -- great.
Do you remember who gave us this?
I'm having the floor fixed,
What?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
Even better.
What do you think?
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Who are you?
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
I'll go first.
You can go first.
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Your life.
Why?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
To talk to you.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Because it's my name.
No.
Why?
Yes -- it is.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
It will not end tonight.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?
Fine.
Why?
The best.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
I guess not.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Jen?  Are you all right?
You won't die if you let me help.
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Then we might as well die rich.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Let me come get him.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
I don't know.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Okey-doke.
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
What do you want?
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Yeah.
All right.  Now the second one.
We can't carry him.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Whatever.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
What are we going to do about Mike?
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
Louise?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What do you want?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
Your phony FBI assholes.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
You want to pay me?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
What's happening?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
I will see what I can do.
No.
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I committed no war crimes.
You think they will believe you?
Great, I really need a shower.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Why sir?
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Thomas wants advice?
The president has been murdered.
What is it, Paul.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Has Roger spoken yet?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
So where is the lamb?
I have to go out to get food.
Why?
What sort of car?
I want to know.
What do we do with all these people?
Not yet.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
More the merrier.
-- what was he doing here?
This thing's going nowhere.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
If you know where it is, get there!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
-- you lose either way, Price --
Don't think it's even an issue.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Where is she?
-- I pose you the same question --
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
My wife. Where were we?
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Sorry.
I'll take my chances.
-- confirming everything we already know --
Please! I need your help.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Oh, no.
-- Eddie!!
-- I'm coming --
What's the matter?
A few years older, perhaps.
I didn't do anything, mommy.
H-how long will it take?
She's down.  Help her...
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
I wish I knew more about her.
What?
What the hell is that?
Oh come on!
What are you talking about?
What?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
Keep talking!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
What will he do?  What does he want?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Wha .... ?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Uh-huh?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
What?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Buying some drugs, alright?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
But how in God's name ...
How do we start?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
You're apologizing?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Eighth room down, babe...
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
You sound disappointed.
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I was the Warden?
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Trust Leonardo....
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that shoe you lost...
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
The Hoopsucker!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...Certain people are --
You know, on farm route 17.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
You can't print that!
Just got hired today!
Tell me about it.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
Awwww, buddy --
Geez, I --
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Ya get the special?
Thank you for waking me.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
You're single?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
But don't you have to work?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I wish I hadn't heard --
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
No, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Well?
And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.
She was beautiful.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
Wesley!
I don't know -- I don't know--
To the asylum?
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
I'm not surprised.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Well?
Ready to go?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
It's what?
I saw you on your bike today.
Please don't.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I used to know how to cook.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
Huh?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Maybe you should have just a half.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
No one.
I don't know.
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Can I come?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Hey Sandy.
All my model planes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I had him!
My partner...
You did your homework, Officer.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Yeah.  All over.
No.
That's right.
Eight years.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
You're not missing much.
Hey...
She wouldn't tell me!
But she was an attractive girl.
But you wanted to.
Told you I could write an ending.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
Nothing if not vampires...
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
No.
Your melancholy eyes...
I want some more.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
And if I cut my hair again?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
You both did it?
Don't mock, Claudia...
And you never cried -
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
This is monstrous!
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
That's not so.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
What do you want from me?
How do you mean, start?
Let's call that a start.
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
The crucifix -
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
Fascination...
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Lestat - finish this -
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You're not lying to me, are you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
But why did you tell her?
How could I not? She had to know.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Yes.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Stupid. Stupid.
Get lost, you scared me.
That could break the machine.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
I'm the King of the World.
Karaoke -- perfect.
You get any sleep at all?
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Be careful, Julie.
I don't know...
Julie?
It was one year ago...
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
What do you mean, Julie?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Why are you doing this to me?
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
He leave you?
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
What an odd question!
What if he is?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..
Theodosia.
She's not too well.
You know that sound, Oliver?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
How did she die?
You are my friend.
Get that ladder up here.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
What'd you say?
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Yes, George?
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Sit down? What are . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Who is it?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Old college graduate now, huh?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Well then, how do you know?
Aw, forget it.
Hello, George, how are you?
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
All of it?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Those Rockefellers!
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Have you notified the police?
With coconuts?
I don't like coconuts.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
About what?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Yeah, just started.
Mary! Mary!
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Great!  Find one for me.
Someone pop your balloon?
Is she responsible for the punch?
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
It's still there!
I know just where to go.
Every day?
What else is there to do?
I'm going.
You stay here a minute.
Michael.
It came up during the meeting.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Do you?
What makes you think there might be?
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?
Let's get the kid home.
Sean's awake.
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
No.
Do you?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
What?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
We have to do something.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
That's it?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Dad!  Dad!
They made me go with them.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
It killed her.  It ate her.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Maybe it's gone.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Next week.
Just like this.
Faster!  Faster!
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
When are we going out?  You and me?
They're turning around.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
No.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
We're ready for you.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Yeah.  Down there.
How many sharks have you killed?
Thank you.
Yeah, you really don't like him.
Damn it!
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
That's a lot of ground to cover.
I talked you into this?
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Kathryn...
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
No,  I'm not going through there.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
... He ought to put him in here.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
Come on!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I am.  You're not.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
I'm sorry.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
I will.
You look like an orange worm.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Not at all.
Why are you?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Philip.
Don't blame yourself.
Musclehead?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
I don't know, what else is there?
No...  It can't be.
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.
How far away is filter number four?
Got a job for me?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Sharks???
He needs a haircut.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
You want to show this?
You'll spoil her.
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Make a list.
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
Then don't come any closer.
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Stop that....
That....
Yes!
I want you to give up that terrible job.
You're damn right I'm serious....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Okay.
I'll be all right, Michael.
I enjoy his company....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
Trying to write our report....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
It's just like driving a car....
No, you're not....
I have my own little island.
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
Won't you get in trouble...?
I have coffee in the thermos.
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Still chasing fish?
Inch by inch....
Feathers all over the place....
The readings suck....
Maybe I missed you too....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
How long?
How long has he been here...?
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
It'll work....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
No way....
Jake.
Here it comes....
I'm training to....
Yes.
What?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Who is who?
Not for me ..
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Now?
I guess by the bed.
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
How do you know her hair's black?
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
Did Amber have a dog?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Which is what?
It's not possible right now.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
When did John divorce?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
That's right.
Now.
Well, no you didn't --
I just heard.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Beer okay?
-- especially one like this.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
I don't know --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
I'll give it everything.
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
No.
Uh, not today, but --
Is that your porty or mine?
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Forget it.  Forget it.
No, I don't know.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
No, you're --
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
I have to ask.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
You gonna get that --
I'll go back to them.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
You okay?
Pardon me?
One-two-three, swing.
Let's go the zoo.
Can you be quiet?
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
What?
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
It's not safe.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
PAUL!
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
Eric!
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
They're here.
How would you classify it?
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I'd better get going.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
Know what this is?
How much of this island have you explored?
You should.
We're safe!
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
How close do you have to be?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
Our chance to do what?
Where's Kelly?
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
It'll hold!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Why did you come here?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
How long will this take?
You shouldn't use my name.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
What?  No menthol?
They are?  I'll be damned.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Oh my God.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
C'mon on, this way.
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Tim, are you okay?
No.
You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -
What'd I touch?!
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Where does he think he's going?
What?  What can we do?
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
I like cows.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Fifty.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
I don't know...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Who's chest?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
Me too. I'm drunk.
See this?
You're not going to be there?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
How long will the effect last?
Ten minutes...
What is it really?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
I usually take lunch by the River.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
... A piece of paper ...
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
Oskar!
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
Amerika for us!
What have you got there?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
There's a light up ahead.
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Why?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Uh uh.
Mm.
I'd just be guessing.
No.
Yes indeed.
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
I guess he figured it was better.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
Like for you to look for the man.
No, I'm look --
You remind me of my uncle.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
-- OK --
I go on rounds.
What're you gonna do next?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
No.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
With Trina.
I am.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
I better keep looking.
Yeah.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
I've just got a few --
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
What else do you know?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Yes?
In real life when does he hit you?
When is mommy coming back?
Mom, I mean dad?
Mom, I mean dad...
You get a new fence.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I'm allergic to onions.
Daddy?
Uh huh?
Is this really your desk?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Was there Burger King?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Who will read me my stories?
Objection!
Did you wish to?
Objection.
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
So do I.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
Was he unfaithful?
I don't recall.
Yes.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
What?
Yes, what?
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
So...what's so terrible about that?
Right.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
What?!  She wants what?!
No, but--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
She ever ask about me?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Not the way to talk to people.
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Yes.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Who am I?
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
America, we shall see.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
Please, come in, so cold.
I leave tomorrow.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
It is possible, Holiness.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Too young?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
You're a beautiful woman.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Go!!!
Is this a trick?
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
No!
Where is he?!
Bastard bit my chopper.
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
In Maine?
What are you talking about?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
Are we crazy?
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Get him onto shore.
If I'm ever in New York...
Now I'm gonna puke.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
What is this?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
<u>You</u>?
Myra.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
I will... I promise.
You're all right! Where is he?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Who's the subject?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Why not?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
Are you finished?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I am, yes.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Your bleeding has stopped.
Ahhh... Why?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed your patient?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Go, Doctor.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
How long did you live there?
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Not "just," Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
There was none!
There was no letter.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
That is the truth!
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Sir!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Gifts?
Yes.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
He did.
Was there such a thing?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Where's Doc?!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
...I'd really have to show it to you.
No!
I'm going inside.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
If he had his blinkers on--
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
It needs blood?
The shack...
I'll kill him!
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Well?
Apart from those shotguns.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Can I help?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
I got the money to pay for 'em.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
There is only three of us here.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
You what? What are you on about?
What do you mean?
Who's this fat man, then?
Why, what's up?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
That you, boy?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I can't help you, Plank.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
So?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Do whatever they tell you--
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
That badge--
Just wondering.
So is Buddy on your short list?
I'm not picking it up.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
Well--
Didn't have a father?
He's still pissed off about it.
So how come you got into all this?
So I'm part-Indian?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Something like that.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Mikey look at this--
Yeah?
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Seriously.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
You get much of that in here?
And people make their choice--
Reputation?
Senora Cruz?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
You go by your old house?
No.
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Do you?
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
How 'bout the Sheriff?
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
There must have been somebody.
Nobody's too busy.
He squeezed money out of you?
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
What?
Mom?
Can I get this?
Morning, Sheriff.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
Three months.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Well, you were working there--
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
How long have you lived here?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
The shooter local?
Yeah.
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Otis what?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Been away. Up to Houston.
You going to tell him?
Who did this?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Will you come to him on your knees?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
And are you afraid?
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
He taught all this to Swann?
You said you weren't with him for love.
Are you sure?
And they all came...
Harry?
I'm here, Harry.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Oh God.
--vanished.
Are you finished with me?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'm here to offer you a job.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
What the fuck are you doing here?
What for?
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
My God.
At birth.  I don't know you --
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Are they all in the business?
Have you been in?
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Is that all?
Is that all?
Yes.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
He's not!  He's not!
Nix! Nix!
Yes! Yes!
Yes.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
What about you? Why are you here?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
No, yes, it does...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Why can't it last?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Bob?
That's not what I'm talking about.
Tomorrow.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I don't know what to do.
Like popcorn?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I don't know.  What are they?
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Seemed...on edge.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
He spoke to you?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
May I help you?
Peter Kelson?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
What do you mean?
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Why did he try to kill me?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
Yes, I know.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
Peter, let go of the chair!
You have to say that.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
What can I do?
Maya?  What do you mean?
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
No I don't.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
That's not it.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
I don't remember that.
Wait...
It's okay.
Damn, girl.
I don't know sometimes.
No.
You do.
What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.
I was just playing ball.
What's that?
I don't care.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
I know this.  What do you want?
A ride home.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Hey.
Figures.
None of your business.
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Forget Tonya Randall.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Quincy...
Hey.
Who's nobody?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You're what?
What are the doctors saying?
With who?
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What's that, not great?
We were just studying.
This is just about money, you know that.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Hello?
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
Uh-huh.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
What the fuck do you want?
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
baby, please, please --
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
Yes.
For what?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
What's that stand for?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Let's make a deal.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
Yeah, of course.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
No, what's wrong?
You live alone?
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
Where's Richard and Julia?
Have you ever been there?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
That's confidential information, little man.
I ain't fuckin with you --
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
Doc it's Janet.
Is it real love?
It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
You see?
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
You mind your own bussines.
...please...
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Yeah.
You do?
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
Who?
Jack.
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
-- let's talk more about your background --
Are you asking me that?
In aid of what?
He passed away.
Psychology major?
...are you Phil...?
Is Linda here?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Is he in pain?
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
The door was open, I got a call --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
You're here.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
No.
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I can't fuckin' do this.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Do you still have to do homework?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
You need to sober up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
Partridge?
That's it.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
Should be one-thirty.
You're late, not me.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
How is he?
Three days??!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Poor Phillippe!
Aramis, this will never --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
It is also a place of burial.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Coming?
Who?
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
But -- are you sure?
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Whose rooms are those?
Phillippe...?
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Your Majesty has had many women --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Magnificent valor...
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Did you hit him?
What did the six-toes have to say?
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
What's this?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
And what did he do to the girl?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Up north.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Why did you set me up?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Donut?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Could he handle a direct contact?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You said the guy down here is good.
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
Tell me now.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
What's it narrow down to?
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
'Changes?'
Where the hell's Graham!
He went to the men's room.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Reba...
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No. I don't want to see you.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
No. I can help you.
I don't want to do that,
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
No.
If I were?
Blue, then.
Blue is cold.
You haven't smoked in two years.
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
You going back down to Florida after?
Thanks for the lift.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How did it happen?
She got all right?
Huh?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
That's interesting.
What do you want?
Pretty well.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
B-but I have them.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
No thanks.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Why Memphis?
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
You're a wimp.
So?  What do they know?
Give me the book.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Positive.
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Why...?  Andy, why...?
Is he in his room?
What's your name?
Bob.
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
He'll be contacting us again.
The sewers.  Of course.
That's the third white van I've seen.
... yes.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
What are you doing?
Is that...?
Five.  Since I've been here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Yes.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
What is he doing?
How long?
How?!
What do you know?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
What are you doing?
Set down in there.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
The beginning?
Yes I do.
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
But what?
Who is?
Go!
What are you doing?
No one has ever done anything like this.
Do what?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Where is it?
What are your plans?
That means it's good.
Well, we want good stuff.
May God be with you.
Jewish...
Get out of here before this really goes up.
And say what?
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
C'mon Johnny.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
What do they expect you to say?
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
Take your time.  I don't care.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
How much?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
It's for the party, Dad --
Honey --!
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
We have an arrangement now.
May I interrupting?
In my sleep.
Sounds good.
It's going to be great --
'Joe...'
Yes.
What do you mean?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
'It's up to Joe'?
But I didn't mean to do it!
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Rass!
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Jennifer.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Love.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Has her pain abated?
'To bed'?
Almost.
He's taking a nap.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Susan --
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
Make an exception?
That's what everybody says.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Okay.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
I'm sorry, Bill --
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I'm not hungry.
Uh --
Yeah.
Say again?
Which is what?
I don't like what you're saying.
Joe, don't do this --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
What do you mean?!
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Next week?
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Drew's aboard?
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Aw, you're tough.
That was wonderful.
Nothing.
Where's Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
But what?
What was that?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Why?
Why not?
39.
47.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
No, let's go.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Who did this to you?
Where'd you get it?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Take the money and walk away!
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Don't remember.
And what did he say?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Sweet.
You're the memory guy?
Who's your boyfriend?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Did Teddy send you?
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Natalie? Natalie who?
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
So was he scared?
Who the fuck are you?
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
This is a drug deal?!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Somehow, I'll know!
No.  I was in Namibia...
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
What do you think?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
Yes you do...
I got to talk to my ADO...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
My end?
How fast does that go?
Where's that?
The Keys?
Were you born in Havana?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Mojitas...?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Why?
Of course.
If they attack you...
I know.  And now?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
What do we got?
To the limit.
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.
Where the hell are you, man?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Where are you?
C'mon, man!
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Yes.  What's up?
Then what were we talking to you for?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You sure you heard what I said?
What you gonna do back there, East?
Must be some mess back there.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
I'm scared.
You bet I do, sir.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Years?
Who?
Shit.
How far?
Sixty Lira?
Not far. Just a little way.
Feeling all right?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
What's wrong?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
We go back.
What?
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
Max - where?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
What is it? . . . Billy?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
What lawyer?
Peter...
There's some weird shit here.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Look, I showed you my badge...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
What are you doing down here?
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I heard how you talked to him.
Oh, come on, come on!
Oh, my!
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Here.
It has no nobility.
Then the roads are open...
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
The what?
I said that?
Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
You don't know?
I'm almost done.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Did they win?
That'd be a first.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Great.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
Not much luggage.
On what.
See anything you like?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
A change of plans?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Fight a bit of a cold..
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
More like two-two point two million.
..or hard wired..
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
What can we do' mate?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
- torque wrench.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
Indeed.
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
And six billion in the world.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Yes?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
What did you think you were doing!
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Like?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
You mean it'll be difficult.
Very.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
I do.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
That simple, huh?
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You have Bellerophon.
Do I?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Satisfied?
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
What happened to Jim?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
You didn't have to.........
Two cars.  Where are you?
Go ahead.
I dont think so.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
Kittridge.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
About what?
You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.
Why don't you come back with me?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Higher.  Higher.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
I guess.
Why not?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Can you lose him?
Where are you?
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Youre probably right.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Its not working.
Uh-huh
I have no money!
Cosmo?
You're welcome.
Okay.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Rose, pass the wine.
I don't know what you mean.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
You look tired.
He got hit by a bus.
Johnny Cammareri.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Yes!
Yes. Do you want...
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
I like it well done.
Where'd Johnny find you?
I don't know.
I'm a wolf?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Where are you taking me?
She didn't like me.
What did I do?
I'll come to the wedding.
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Hi.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
A month from today?
Who is he?
Have you told her we're getting married?
And who's gonna pay for that?
No. But I have a hangover.
She recovered.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Do you love him, Loretta?
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
Oh.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Alright.
Don't fight.
Don't make yourself sick.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
Where is she?
Maybe I should go?
That's it! That's the reason!
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
People home.
What? What?
What would he be doing down there?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Through ... We found them.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
We don't have a lord.
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
NI!   NI!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
What, "is"?
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Be quiet!
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
That's easy!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Did you kill all those guards?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well ...
Camelot ...
Sir Gawain.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
We must examine you.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
She loved him.
What?
I've got my duties to attend to.
You know nothing about her!
What's this?
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
A situation?
Convey her a message.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
You'll be sent a message.
No.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
I am a blank sheet.
Oh.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Aye.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Why do you think I keep her here?
See what?
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
Who by?
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Must they always follow us?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am?
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Erysipelas.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
Again?
How do you stop The Screamer?
He thinks I'm "sublimating".
Hello?
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
It is.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Because I didn't know where else to go.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
That's what I thought.
What?
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Alex...
One.  In case...
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.
And then keep on driving?
What did he do to you?
I'm thinking!
Of course I am.
That's impossible.
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
So start at the beginning...
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Howdy!
No problem. What's on your mind?
One.
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Wow!
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
There was an accident. I came here.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
My name is Rita.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
Yes, there was.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No.
But, this could be serious.
Mulholland Drive.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
I don't think...
Wally Brown.
What's  the matter now?
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
I just wanted to come here.
I had a dream about this place.
Yeah, they showed me
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Interesting.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
What's going on ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
We drown.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
You okay ?
I work here, remember ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
What's next Walt ?
It's fine thanks.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Stop the hydraulics.
When will that be ?
When you are ready.
What's wrong ?
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Thank you.
Do you want to go out with me ?
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Not now, Mom.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Good morning.
Do you still teach?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
What do you remember about her.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Yeah.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
How about a nice glass of milk?
You are?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.

Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Well...
That's okay.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
See you? He can smell you from there.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Is it okay if I drink this?
Hello.
Hi.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Vada?
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You would.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
And I thought I was weird.
Boyfriend?
Come and get it.
Woah, watch it!
It's dangerous!!
Right.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
But...are you engaged or something?
Oh...what's that?
Hi!
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
I mean...with your car.
They're enormous, I know.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
You're such a baby.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Yes.
No.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Kiss me.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
VADA!
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Yes.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Oh, Vada...
Do you think she is?
No.
She's shy.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Shut your big fat mouth!
Uh huh.
What are they about?
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Hurry!
You could pick that scab on your arm.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Where's your bike?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
Heaven.
THIS!! 
I am running faster!!
Come on, let's go.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
I wanna live with them too.
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
Like this?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Needs salt.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
Go figure you.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
But I can't be dry.
Can you watch the road?
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
So... one almost has to...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
... look good on Kimberly.
Well, you're a little early...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
Endearingly absent-minded.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
This thing means that much to y...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
I never forgot that.
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
I hate that music.
You're from out of town?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
What's wrong with her.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
How is that?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Third party?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
You want anything?  A drink?
What's he running for?
ABC.
D.C.
National?
Come on. He's a crook.
Not yet.
He's my father.
Mr. Green?
I'm fine. Can I go up?
What?
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
You know anything about the stations here?
You in music?
Wrecks.
Nashville.
And before?
Hello.
Who is thin?
I don't know who you are.
Stay.
Well...
I'm twenty-eight
Premeditated murder.
I'm not sure...
Linnea?
It's me. What is it?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Where's Bill?
I mean...
Do you study at all?
Oh --
He ain't really new.
He is to a lot of people.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You always live there?
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Is that good?
It's not bad.
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Oh, why thank you.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Hasn't it?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
I can appreciate that.
How come you never talk?
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
I'm sure we will.
Says the United States of America.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Where's it parked?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Yes.
I admire them.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
How's it working, Scotty?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
How so?
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Lose 'em.
What are we talking about?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Out.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
What did you say your name is?
Where's he at?
Okay.
Okay.
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
What d'you expect?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Get out of here!
But I would like to see you again.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Goin' to see my kid.
I'll have some coffee, please.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
What's wrong?
Am I as good as they?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Don't, Duff.
You will.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
How 'bout the key?
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Who're you?
Seems a little loose!
Going back, huh?
Hell, I'm just like him.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
How are you?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
It ain't in me.
It's for your own good.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Let's stay here, Will.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
Alright. Let's talk business.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Dixie McCoy
What are you talking about?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
What are you talking about?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Hey, bro.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Never heard of him.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
You're late.
How's the ice?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
What about the mainframe's access code?
Want to fucking answer them?
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I had to limit your options.
What is it?
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Maybe something's onto him.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
I'll get the car.
Something exotic I hope.
Shit...
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
YOU DID.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Forget it.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
A flack jacket.
Do you even know these kids?
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
You having fun?
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Rufus?
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Oh I don't think so.
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
I know.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
No, I'm alone.
Please. Please don't walk away.
That is so sad --
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
You ruined the whole thing!
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Aloha! Welcome!
By name.
Yes.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
No.
We're here!  You sent for us!
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Oh, come on Dad...
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
What about it?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Why won't you talk to me?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Jess?
Okay, I guess.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
Hi, Kerry.
All of them.
We're going up to bed now.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
Hi Mom.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Good morning, Jennifer.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I gotta stay up, Max.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
Horseshit.
So what do we do about this creep?
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
A little basic, but nice.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
You're late.
Sorry.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
And what are they?
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
And then I... right.
Well, they can be.
No.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Oh -- Okay.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Floppy, huh?
So who left who?
No, you were brilliant
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
Cartwright.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Oh please sod off.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Can I have your autograph?
What's your name?
What does it say?
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
And we intend to use them!
Working with Leonardo.
What do you think?  Good move?
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
I suppose so.
Right -- want another one?
No, it doesn't.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
Hello.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Cool, huh?
Hey.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Maybe.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Oh, I had them removed.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Welcome back.
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
What's your name, buddy?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
What is it, kid?
In ya go...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Yeah, where we going?
Did to me?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
With your own two hands?
Okay, sucker.
Don't you have any clubs?
Yeah, buddy?
'Kay, place your bets.
Bet a nickel!
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Yeah, buddy?
How much ya wanna bet?
Got a cigarette?
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, what's up?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Tha's your problem.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
At this hour?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
That!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, yeah...
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
May I see your boarding pass, please?
What for?
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Yes.  We did.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Yes.
Does he love you?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Where's Positano?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
What?...
What are you doing here?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
I can't believe you did that!
Beautiful place...
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
How about the other one?  His friend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Yes you did.
Come on, it's not so bad.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
Does Dwayne know about this?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
What are you doing?
You expecting somebody you know?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Packing.
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Peter found him?
Maybe I can change him.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Boss loader!
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Wow... .
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
What happened?  What happened?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles. 
What makes him so special?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
What a fruitcake you are!
Our Lord said just the opposite.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
What for?
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You are like
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
What do you want from me, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You can!
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
I'm just resting my feet.
Really?
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
I told you lay off.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
My favorite little cousin.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
You're talking nonsense.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
You love me then?
...And what is this?
What kind of symbol?
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I will decide the conclusion.
For what!?!
You mean...!
You better hope there is.
Then why do you shake so?
What do you suppose for?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You're good.
Adele?  You in there?
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
It's Richard Ripley.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Oh, man.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
What?!
Nice disguise.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Yes, she did.
Shit.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
In the trunk, yeah?
I have to qualify, is that it?
All right, but...
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Karen, I told you not to--
There a problem, Foley?
How much for your company at chow?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
Let's go outside and talk.
You comfy?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
You don't act like it.
Is that right?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
And your gun.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
Those guys bother you?
You like bourbon?
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
So she did help you?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
You're not dumb.
You just did, for Christ sake.
I see better with them on.
Okay.  How many going out?
I hear six.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
What's to think about?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Islamic.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Meaning?
You busted out?
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Flyweight.
No.
It's beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Oh, he's moved out?
No thanks.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
No?
So?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
How do I look, mama?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Well, I need that...
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
...the fuck is this...
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
You liked that?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Good shooting, Rafe!
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Get me into a plane!
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
I can't make it.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
So beautiful!
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Well sure, Colonel --
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
Danny's not coming?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
Leapin' Jesus!
Fook ya!
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
I'm sorry Charlie.
What're you doing here?
Just take a look at it. 
Forget it, it'll never work.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
What're you doing here anyway?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
I'm excused.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
What happened to you?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
What are you doing?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
What's inside?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Like what?
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Silicon is from sand.
I hear you moved into town.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Hey! How was your first day at school?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Zowie...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name... ?
Allright. Calm down.
K-R-O-one.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
It could be parasites, an infection...
Why are you getting dressed?
We're not skipping this treatment.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
No.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Ready for what, baby?
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Innocuous?
Client of yours?
Little baby girl.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Get it?
Sure. It's fine.
You survived your first gay party intact.
What have you prayed for?
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
I suppose you could say that.
Not unnecessary ones.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
In some situations.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
In what way?
Objection!
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
In a word, yes.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Lots.
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Fine, Joe.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
That's perfectly clear.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Probably okay to talk to me now.
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Entered our minds.
What about her?
As fast as you can.
Like the light is scalding it.
What?
So now you know.
He used that?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Just shut up, okay?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Owens!
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
...then we saw this.
Well, you got the big gauge.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Not if I'm the one.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
What's her name, anyway?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
'Then how do you account for me?,
You didn't think so then.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
That way.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Climb off me, will you!
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
I think you're making a mistake.
Who put them up?
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Shhhh!
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Listen-
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
But the proof? The doll?
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Where's Elias come from?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
What you got there - beers?
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
I don't know.
Would you mind?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think you're drunk.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
Whatever you say.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Ale. I don't mind.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You were there when I last saw him.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
I expected nothing else.
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
What?
It was lying where on the balcony?
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Mitchell was too drunk.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
How would you know, Brandon?
What are you doing here?
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
Floater?
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Send that?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
That leaves two strangers.
Ye have, have ye?
What are my orders, sir?
So-so.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
I will, thanks.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
What went wrong?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
No.  I'd want to--
And you're at this third stage
Why not stay?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
I might.
It's shit.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Why not sit down and wait?
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Not bad.
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Oh no!
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
No.
Friends of yours, huh?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
I can't do this.
I say when it's over!
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
Good move.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
This Zen master surfer.
They're on their way to Maui.
They took a left at the next light!
Who's the girl?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
What story did you give to Davis?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
I'll see you there.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
That's over the border, General.
I think it's Hawkins.
Where the hell is his body?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He knows our defenses.
There's no way you could know that.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Better believe it.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
What do you like?
No?  Why's that?
Not... quite.
You're upset, huh?
Television?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
Aw, don't... no...
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
We just did.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Looks slow tonight.
Kit...
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
Kit give me nothin'.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
What if they serve soup?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I killed him myself.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
He knows I do not love him.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
Does it bother you to hear?
And what am I?
But how can you be sure?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
Faster!
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Inigo.
It won't be easy, Sire.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Sorry.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
You're sure nobody's following us?
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
You're that smart?
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
Then make your choice.
What's so funny?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"By the light, by the light,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Oooooooops!
Mr. Bialystock ...
But that's cheating!
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
What did I do?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Where would you like to eat?
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What kind now, Leo?
Maybe you're happy.
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
You found a flop!
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
Yes.  We would!
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Not.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Always.
Finder's keepers.
We can't play today?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
By the sacred memory...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
No.
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
Cash.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Now, look...!
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She stole some money.
Did he say anything about my sister?
I'm Mary's sister.
What thing?
I ought to call the police right now!
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Where's the old highway?
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Stay here.
Sam.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Let's go see Al Chambers.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
Sam!
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
Dirty night.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
You're very... kind.
You'd know, of course.
Uncommon, too.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
Thank you, Norman.
You slept here all night?
Is there?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Wait a minute!
Oh?
Mary is Lila's sister?
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
Did you hear?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You would.
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
You mean he was colored?
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
And they never proved anything against him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
That's what I said.
Do you know George Winton?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
What does that prove?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I'd know him anywhere.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
We flopped the first time out.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What did you expect?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
Buddy, you're just a child.
You better quit that.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
You won't die, Rose.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well, a little.
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Why is it taking so long?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
How goes it, darlin'?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
What time is it?
Quarter of twelve.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
What did you forget?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Yes, sir.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
You're so sweet.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Strange voices, Rose?
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
Mine.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
I see. Outside it.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Oh, no, ma'am.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
Incestuous.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Wh... what... ?!
Wha... ?
What the... ?!  What was that for?
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
There probably is.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Pure horse.
Slow down.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
What... ?  Not you too?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Let's get this thing done.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
Why the beach?
Know what I love about dynamite?
You always did have style.
The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
There's still good in him.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Are you all right?
Fine. Together again, huh?
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
Hey!
Lando, grab it!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
What's he saying?
Your father?
I know, father.
Come with me.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet.
I've got something to say.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
No, don't do that.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
Goodbye
Oh, no no, no no.
...I don't know.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
It's Thanksgiving.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Morning after?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes.
Would ya take off your glasses?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
I can't go out.
Why?
Christ.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Owe you what?
You busted?!
What?!
He won't last one round.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
I don't like ya face.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Seven minutes!
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
What about for food an' stuff?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
What?
I like yella teeth.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Come July, twenty-five.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
What's happened is freak luck.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
How 'bout a glass of water?
...What?
Really think so?
Whatta you get outta this?
God bless ya, Rock.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
...Maybe I better forget it.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...Tight.
What?
Ya really like her?
To see ya train.
Outta my house I want ya!!
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Check the scrawl.
So you decided to help him after all?
So what's the scam, Eddie?
Maroon, right?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Surprised?
Does it hurt?
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Doom.
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
What the hell are you doin'?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
I'll get it.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Welcome.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Goodnight.
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
What?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Ahhh!
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If my heart's dear love--
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Right.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
I still am.
Nobody's saying they don't.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
It's quite satifactory.
Do you have it?
And more importantly --
We'll die if we stay here!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
That's it.
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
Not exactly.
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I didn't expect that he would.
So what is it you want to know?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
I ride with fat-boy...
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
So is the woman.
How did you know?
The question still remains: what do we do now?
It was at that.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
You see the bullet?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
How could you have done that?
I'm not here very much.
Business keeps you on the road?
If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Would you stop with that...
Gone.  Destroyed.
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Can you get it?
Damn.
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
Why?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
Here it is.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
Uh huh.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
What for?
Has he?
OK.  I love you.
He's not, he's...
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
I know.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally, do you love me?
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
I don't know.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Don't you have to be here?
Yeah.
Lingerie...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Sure.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
I got my sources.
Is this about the funny money?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
Those girls drove off because of you.
No.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
It's my job!
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
No, no, that would be crazy --
You said --
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
What did you say?
She's getting undressed.
What?
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
End of the line.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Lee!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
What's going on?
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Why don't you go get them?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
You speak English!
It's the same thing!
That silly-ass look on your face.
I was being polite.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
What?
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
Shut up!
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
And in a "V".
What?
In vino veritas.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
Originality is my speciality.
That's fair.
Five hundred.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Can you fix it?
Of what?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
No.  It's my life.
Yeah.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Walter, I'd love to --
And then I'll see you in New York --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
No.
Walter.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
You okay?
What?
It's not true, but it feels true.
What was what?
You're a basket case.
I should say something in this about magic.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Turn on your radio!
You told a lie and got on a plane.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
So I mailed your letter.
You're going to miss the train.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's me?
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Hey, my plate is full.
You'll find out.
You'll like it.
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Eighty dollars.
Window.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
It's never happening again. Right?
It plays in 50 states.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
I don't know.
I'm starting to forget her.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Thank Victoria for dinner.
No.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Did too.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like it?
Well...
Yes?
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
It takes time --
Mornin'.
You haven't tried locking them up!
No, Estellita.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Never... never... never!
A fighter, huh?
Let them take it!
Over my dead body.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
You weren't waiting for me.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
This is what we've been waiting for.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
No.
What?
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
You like that?
I can't.
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
And you admire that?
What do you want from me, Colette?
This has nothing to do with him.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
Who is it?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
Really, I don't want to.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
What?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Danny?
No one ever noticed?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
You don't understand.
You want to do this some other time?
What?
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You've got no choice.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
To who?
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Nervous?
Tom, let's spend the night here.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Just no pleasing you, is there?
Just admit you're wrong.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
You must be a hell a shot.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
Upham?
I heard.
You know classical music?
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
Captain, what about our deal?
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Huh?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Maybe Caen.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
Damn fool.  Sir.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
C'mon, just do it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Yes.
I don't feel anything.
Come on, it's graduation.
Lloyd is doomed.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Oh yeah!
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
What?
Dad.
Okay, I give up.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Did he ever get rough with you?
But I found the money.
Honey, it's not what you think.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah?
Are you busy on Saturday?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Nobody knew me before tonight.
You know what?
What?
You have to meet Bess.
No.
Be friends?
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
It was wonderful.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
I'm sorry.
What?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Hello Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
My car.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I love you man.
Now you're back.
You know what, you'd like her.
Luck.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Scherner told me something else about you.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
You want these people.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
Look -
Where are the guards?
What's that?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.
What do I got for you?
What are you doing?
Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.
Thank you.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I didn't do enough.
Stop it...
Cici. Who's this?
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Where's Sid?
No way.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
Why?
Where's Sid?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
She's got guards with her.
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
Just for you, Sid.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Let's go.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Sid, I'll come with you.
I got a surprise for you.
Gotta.
That was good.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Take it off.
I'll be right back.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Can I help you?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
What?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
What?
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Hello.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Hello?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
It's on the table.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
I wanna let go. I do...
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
What?
Who is this?
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Guess.
Don't hang up on me.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
How do you know his name?
Please don't do this...
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Evening, ma'am.
You never know when or where a story will break.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Have they found my father?
She staying with you?
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
That fish smelled strong.
What is it? Where's Casey?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Are you alone in the house?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Hello?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Stop. Right there.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Jesus, this place is packed.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You're crazy -- both of you.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Do you believe this shit?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
And you believe it?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
That's not necessary.  You're in.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
How you feeling?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You should be thanking me.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
What the fuck is going on?
You just met me.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Who said this was murder?
You think it was poison?
Is that clear?
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
There must be something.
What?
He just may be nuts enough.
I wish I still thought like you.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Oh, that's all.
The fingerprints.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
And so what?
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
You got to be kidding.
How is this legal?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
What are you going to say?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
What are you talking about?
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
I don't see anything.
It smells good.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Crime of passion.
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
I didn't give any order to fire!
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Talk!
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
You all right, Ethan?
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Futterman?
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
Ethan, quit it!
No...She's not...
They'll be back...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Not far from it...
Comancheros...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
She's not a little girl any more.
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
But couldn't you...?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
But what is the truth?
Do I look like it that much?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
We should leave the past alone.
WillWhere is Mercutio?
Ah
Follow that boat!
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Do you know that house?
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
We will all be put in the clink.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
The title?
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
Most interesting.
I have a wonderful new play!
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
This time we take your boots off!
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Who wrote that?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
No, it will turn out well.
What do we do now?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Be good to her, my lord!
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Like Valentine and Silvia?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
You can bring them with a word.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Let him be damned for his pages!
Nono.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
I have spoken with your father.
Take off your hat.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
And break her heart and mine?
She loves me, Thomas!
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
Will you shut up and play.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
You call them if you want.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Is this necessary?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
I don't know.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where do you think you'll go?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
No. Why should it?
That's right.
Yes, thanks.
Yes.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Cameron.
Yes.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- which is --
You see, they don't really know me.
David?
So?
Open it.
You want me to kick it open?
Now?
Don't look?
No.
What's he doing here?
Are you all right?
I don't see the point in that.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
No.
I'll wait there.
What?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Can you afford this place?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Two hundred.
What?
I'm sorry.
Yes.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
Right here?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
A certain weakness.
What?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
I don't know, I think...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Why not?
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Wow.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Hi.
Want me to?
No thanks.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Am I what?
Yeah...
No.
Then what do you think?
Right.
Wonderful woman.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
So how's Norman?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
You would?
Why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
I don't know what gets into me.
He still having parties?
Am I entertaining you?
-- where'd you go?
Look who's talking.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
God, there's Lester...
Yeah!
Wash her.
-- White ladies?
Otis is dead.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Not yet.
How are you, baby?
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
What!
George.
George.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
When?
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
George...
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
All night.
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
What, do you think I planned it?
Did they have something against me?
Who?
She's nothing but a whore.
No --

What do you mean?
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
A daytime soap opera.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Who were you talking to?
Steve?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Fine.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Well... sure...
George? Was he alone?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Jill.
Thank you.
No!
Tony.
Who's Tony?
I won't make any noise.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Please...
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Well how can I repay you?
It's okay, really.
And, er... where are they now?
A nigger!
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Good.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Perfect for a child.
What time is it?
Did you find anything?
Jack...
Stay away from me,
Stop swinging the bat.
Jack, stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'm Jack Torrance.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
Sure.
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Yeah... sure.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
But Uncle Al! You said-
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
No... it's fine.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Where did that come from?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Just about.  Show me again.
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
It's true -- I know her.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Three years.  Sister.
A novice.
You have to help me
Excuse me?
Experience!  Right?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Are you leaving us?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
St. Anne's?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Yeah?
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
A vote?
You sent for me?
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
But...
You saved my life.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Ten flights?
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Hey, girls.
Hail, Mary.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
However, we can also pray for other things.
It's so beautiful...
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
She's... she's a nun.
Where?
If we could speak alone.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
What are you spying on?
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Your superiors are two days away!
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Are you familiar with magnets?
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
In test... what?
Did your father take a loan?
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
If you want.  But...
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
I... I can't do this.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
The Horseman.  Yes.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
Thank ye.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How are you, Bill?
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
I'll see you, Bill.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
They let you out?
I reckon I feel all right.
Yeah.
All right then.
All right then.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon.
Karl, you up?
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Right now?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
We sure like havin' you.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
I reckon not.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Okay.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Do you smell shit?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I didn't mean that.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
Why?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
American literature. What else?
Jesus, what happened to you?
What happened?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
I'd love to.
What'll it be, Auggie?
Huh?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
How'd you get started?
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I mean, it's a good story.
You're looking good, Auggie.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Yeah, like what?
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Five thousand bucks.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
The refrigerator?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Just passing through.
Not a one.
What's your offer?
Benefits?
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
That's where the what comes in.
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Drawing's a good thing.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
What time is it?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
I just did.
His only copy?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Yeah, I picked it up.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Now, Mister Gi...
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You always run with the well open?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You wouldn't even see it move.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Does it now?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
I believe so.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
What else could it be?
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
For certain, no.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Improved...how?
Upsy-daisy.
Of course I am.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
I told you - it's a sure thing.
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
You mean it's a girls' band?
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
As far away as possible.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Men?
Good night, Daphne.
Blow where?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
I'll say there is!
Like right after the ceremony.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
I'll say.
And that's one of them.
Anything wrong?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
I may spill something.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
We better have a drink first.
Josephine -
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
We won't breathe a word.
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Have you ever been with a male band?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Every time!
You know - I play tenor sax.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Glasses?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Saxophone player?
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Which one is yours - the big one?
For your own amusement?
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Why?
Would you mind moving along, please?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
Been waiting long?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Where's your shell collection?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
From a rich millionaire.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Good evening, sir.
Booze.
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
I sleep with my spats on.
You and who else?
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
You know what I love about all this?
Except its Scotch.
I dont think I can go through with this.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I had to say something to get you here.
But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Hey.
So, whats your point?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
How did you know that was me?
You shit!
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Hey, Sal.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Nothin'...
No, Miss Johnson...
No buts, Rita!
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
What's that, son?
Sunday...
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
David!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?
Is he gon' be gone long?
I wanta get some things.
Good mornin', Nathan.
Well, let's get to work!
But, Nathan--
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wanta see Nathan.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
YOU DO?!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Who are you, kid?
I am Satan. I am your God, now.
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Aw, ma!!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
SHIT!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Thank you, Kenny.
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Yes?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
What if I just left?
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Yeah!
Wendy?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
What did you say to me?
All too well, captain.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
You better start making sense!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
That's right.
So you were looking for a new challenge.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Why can't we?
I can't let you do that.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
What?  What are you talking about?
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Where's Taylor?
I'm homesick.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
I guess so.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
How is it looking, Mac?
Can I get you something for the road?
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
You know, Elvis bowled.
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
They suspended me for 100 years.
What do you think I can do?
Grace Skinner.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Theo.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
My poor baby!
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
Junior who?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
He's my father, Millie.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Won't your father help you with that?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Do you have a girlfriend?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
What's plan C?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
Nothing.
It?
How do you get this thing down?
I feel sick.
Why did you come back?
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Very professional.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
I can't see...
How big is this spacecraft?
Norman!
Nobody move.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
-- Wait a second --
They pressurize us with helium.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Nothing, sir.
Well, where the fuck is he?
It's chipped.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Resetting the sub.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
My gosh, Norman.
Yeah, it was awful.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Don't do this.
Beth --
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You, me and Harry?
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
You don't trust me?
But I don't know how --
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
The refridgerator.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
He translated it wrong.
You think, in the sphere --
How can the sphere do that?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
I'm sorry.
Your watch.
I'm feeling better.
You know what I mean.
Did you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
I promise --
Then where's it coming from?
How's that?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
What happened to her?
Her suit's gone.
Beth left?
How do we decode it?
Fine.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Her legs are in the way.
What does Norman already know?
What is it, Harry?
English?
But it's impossible.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Do you?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Captain who?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
What report?
He wasn't feeling well.
Squint harder.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
Fear is their greatest weapon.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Is that good or bad?
I know that.
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
Are you all right?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Yes, sir.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Where are you taking us now anyway?
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I read you sir.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
So what are you doing later ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Why not ?
Carl can wait.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
You talk to Carl ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
What ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Uh, look, Diz...
No thanks, Diz.
Well, see ya.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Good good, then it's all settled.
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
What do you think you're doing ?
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
How bad are you, pal ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Uh, I don't know.
What is it, Rico ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Hit your jets, sir !
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Not for us?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
To you, sir?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
You like my play.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Everyday things...yes.
I <u>can</u>?
About <u>conflict</u>...
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Great.  Who is it...?
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
I don't drink.
Read the card.
Why?
Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Is it...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Oh yeah.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Not without a rolltop desk.
What are you going to do?
Morning, darling.
We on for tomorrow night?
Yes, that's right.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
That's so beautiful...
We had a date.
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
What?
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
I loved it...he...
Mornin, sister.
What do you drink?
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
She's a...
What I...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
The Mayor's outside.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
That's my...
We're just talking about the...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
Yes.
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
-- she's got 'religion.'
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
I have to talk to you.
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
Later for you, pal.
What's in the case?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
You want me to lie.
You didn't see it...
I left that for you.
I'm gonna' bring it off.
<u>Stop</u>...
Pay her off.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Mmm.
...not at all...
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
It takes all kinds.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
This'll work, huh?
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
That doesn't bother me.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
In high school.
I hate her.  I really hate her.
...your hating me.
Cos she loves you.
Then have a donut --
No.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
I have lava.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
What honey?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Yes.
Rache says it's from you.
That's necessary, huh?
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
Easy enough.
Our children.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
We're going to win this.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What did you do?
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Look, I...
I need practice.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Anxiety.
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
You bet you are.
I don't, but...
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Moi?
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
She's devastated.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
It's the same choice you made.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
You'll learn.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
It's just an assignment.
What if he is?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
I'll be your guest!
Jesus was not bad.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
This is definitely better.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
You mean, again?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You know he hated my story also.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Come here, give me a hug!
What are you doing here?
That's good.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Again!!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Great!
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
Yeah.
How many?
How'd you get it?
Scooby, don't! Be careful!
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
He did?
Y-yes--
What are we going to do!
What do you mean?
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
It's nothing to worry about.
Come on, drink up.
Good.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
What does that mean?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
I have your word, Mister President?
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
That's government property, Major.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
General Schmuck?
No, sir.
General Schmuck?
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
You aren't sure!
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
A shooting war!
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
Ask away, Major.
I see.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Right.
Go on, Major.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Then there's no chance for recall?
How many planes did we lose?
Look, he's there, and you're here.
What's the target.
Roger, maintain.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Second safety.
Master safety.
Yes, Major.
How do you know he's dead?
Look, this is different.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Sorry, King.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Um-hm.
I don't anymore.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Hey!
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
Stuck with what guy?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
Don't let 'em fight.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
No, no.
Good.
Sure.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
What, they're looking for her?
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Guess not.
So, how was the ride, kids?
Am I fucking him?
Yes! Free concert!
I'm so burnt-out.
You better! Yes!
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
It's a mistake to think that.
Taking care of business.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
It's coming along.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Wow. You did that for me?
Why? Because I give a shit?
No.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
No.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
So you can give me more shit?
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Mm-mm.
No, no.
No, I don't.
What?
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Hey, Pony.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Yeah, I crash there.
The prom. That's funny.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
Now?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Camel jockey.
Look, get down off my property.
I hope you're happy!
It's stupid.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Yeah.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Di, we're sorry.  We...
You sure?
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Y'think?
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Yeah, hold on.
Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
You sure you wanna go there?
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Hi, Artie.
Good party.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Are you hungry?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Second generation, huh?
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Why not?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Hers.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
Where do you live?
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Cut away from me?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Why do you say that?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
Goodbye.  Norma.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
What's the matter, Max?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
How's that about your being my friend?
Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
Paramount studios.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
What does it mean?
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Is this Nigel's doing?
You love me?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
That makes it worse.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
Miss what?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
What is it?
And you think you're in love.
You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't understand.
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Don't you believe in knocking?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Who are you ?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
It's lovely. . .
Then come with me.
You're going to take me back?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
The kid needs a man to show him --
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Too much mayonnaise?
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
Call me.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Thirty-five.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
How many sugars?
Black or regular?
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
When?
What will it get me?
Thanks.  Let's go
What about me?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
What terrific story?
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Where's the light switch?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
Okay? Goodbye.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Missing????
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Oh Clark, no!
I was right. you are Superman.
Maybe you wanted to.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Sleep well?
"They?"
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Everything on it?
Uh...home...
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
A parka.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
North.
Shhhhhhh!
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
What shall we do now?
Look, they need a machine to fly.
You are master of all you survey.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
No Paris?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I know, but  --
Lois isn't here?
Mom...
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Stop him, Clark!
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
You're not the only one.
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Oh.
You and your real estate.
Meteorites!
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
They stop for nothing.
Don't let me down.
There was a recipe on the back  --
You're not going to hit me?
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I'm wearing it.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
He sure as heck does that.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
He will be odd, different.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Right on the first guess.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
You think they're strange?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
On radio waves?
Luthor  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
They'll soon be over.
Which one?
Which one?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
I'm...so sorry.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Billy, please.  The children.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Your kids never cry.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
Because I have to.
Yes.
For rabbits?
From what?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
You've talked to Billy?
Yes.
Away from your crazy Mom.
You want a cup of tea or something?
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
From you?
What's a ditty again?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
That's right.
The people in the town?
Oh.
You seem very sure about that.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
DADDY!!!
News?
Don't you want to hear?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Are you expensive?
How does the family survive?
You remember that much?
You could see the speedometer?
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
How will he do that?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
There's talk of that.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Did she accept?
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Why, has he bothered you before?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Can't hurt...
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
What about?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Who else phoned?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
J.J., if you think -
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Those lying motherfuckers!
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Excellent.
She intends to change the future somehow.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Is it dead?
It must end here... or I am the future.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
John, get out of the way!!
Kyle, don't go!
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
I must be destroyed.
On Furtwngler.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
and totally irrelevant.
With more what? More what?
Colonel. Pleasure.
Not yet.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
And what was that?
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Tell me about von der Null.
And what did he say?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
And what happened to Von der Nul?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
I don't understand what you mean.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Yeah?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
So, you never heard of him.
Right. Claims assessor.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
First oboe.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Do you understand?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Bag some Z's?
That's where we're going.
Not possible.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
Call her.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
Did you play recently?
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
There's got to be a flashlight.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
That's classic.
What is it?
Well... the red bra.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm back from the dead.
Get us out of here...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
No...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
You need anything?
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Are you still on mediction?
I'm going to call.
Who?
It's them.  They did this.
Split it?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
What's all this for?
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
Get rid of them.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Fine.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Attractive...
What's happened...
You're joking.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
That could have been worse.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
All night?
Nell!
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Does she know that's why you're using her?
I don't know.
It was.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Oh God, we can't get out!
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Why?
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Theo... Did you?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I don't think I want any.
Is that a problem?
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
We think someone is here.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
You broke last time.
Been to the Boat Show.
What more is there.
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
What?
What's so fucking funny?
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
I've been wondering something.
Had a feeling it was you.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Been busy, have you.
What was that, then?
Oh, it just ended, then.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
-- Your employer?
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
I see.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
Depends, don' it.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Just now?  Overnight?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
It was you.  Downtown.
Of the deal, man.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Been away a lot.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
I got half.
Good luck.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
Like what.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
How we gonna get that lucky?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Is Valentine here?
What.
Yes. Thank you.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
...You don't like the music out there?
Yeah.
Oh, Mr Crane--
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
Geez, Mr Crane.
You're an enthusiast.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
I can get it, yeah.
...You bring a check?
How's business, Dave?
All right, I guess.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
Mm.
...What kind of man *are* you?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
...I don't get it.
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...Huh?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
Jesus...
This hair.
I don't understand.
What'd he say?
'Lo, Ed.
...You're Ed Crane?
...I'm Crane.
Yes, sir.
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Not an owner.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
It better be good.
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
I'll go down and speak to him.
Sweet Jesus!
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
I think I should come with you.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
What happened?!
I hope you liked it.
Curious.  There's something missing.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Read it out loud.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
You're not.  Where is it?
The planetarium!
What is it doing?
What happened?
Help someone!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
Sure she would.
Now.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
I've got to talk to you.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
It'd be an adventure.
What did you want?
I made macaroni.
--we need more charcoal.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
I'll try.
Well, thank you for your help.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
We don't even know you.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
What's that?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
You know my work?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
How can I reach you?
I've been using you?!
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
Where are you, Mulder?
What? What are you talking about?
What are you implying, Scully?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
Evidence of a massive infection.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
All the equipment is brand new.
What?
This virus -- it... 
What are you doing?
You can't quit, Scully.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
I need you on this, Scully --
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
Are we being watched?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What do you mean, walked?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
He hates me.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
Then what is he?
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
You're kidding me.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Thank you.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Why?
Drink?
When...what did you do?
It's just what he used to say.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Have you seen Calloway?
Are you going, too?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Of course.
...parents.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
I don't want it.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Can you tell me whose...
Him dying like that.
...to him.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
...a week ago.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Very good, sir.
I'll look it up for you.
You do!
Come upstairs a moment.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What is it, Sergeant?
Hello, Harry.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
You've got plenty of contacts.
...were of you.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Find out?
Already gone.
Baron Kurtz.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Harry...
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Big?
Have you told someone?
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
What's a fascist?
They don't have extermination camps.
What do you care?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
Which is what?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
I'm coming to your room tonight.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
And be crushed.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
An investment banking house.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
You wouldn't announce it?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Is it okay if I record this?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Those aren't Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
How do you reconcile the two?
It was a nine millimeter.
Think about your father. Your sister.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Don't tell me what I --
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
What are you doing here?
Tell it to Hitler.
Get out of here....
What is it?
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
You said they didn't have night guards.
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
What are you trying to say?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
It's Friday....
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Oh, fuck you...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
What do you mean?
You're going to live here permanently?
Are you going to keep it?
Yes.
Does he know?
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
You know each other?
In a lake.
Congratulations.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Checking out the competition.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
What about the shoes?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
Madame...
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Can I come in?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
... How long was I asleep?
... Push me back in the water...
In the lake?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
You look adorable.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I'd better get back now.
How can you tell it's a female?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Hello?
I didn't dive.
What's wrong?
Promise me one thing.
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Way past it.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Why is he doing this?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Wait!  Professor...?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
We do!
What are you doing here?
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What's wrong with him?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
A stereo type alarm system?
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Mmmyes.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
He will be waiting...
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Yes?
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
Come to look around?
Some crazy guy.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
To the eye? Like other men.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
It's better you don't know.
Tell me.
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
Why?
That's a fact, isn't it?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
I can use them.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Sorry?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Something like that.
Where is that?
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?
What do you suggest?
A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
By your Austrian?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Weve still got the Italian...
How much of a hurry are you in?
I see. How much?
No... No...  I swear...
Where are the kids?
And who does Friedman work for?
The company. We all work for the company.
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?
Good.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Lets go.
Am I supposed to know him?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Where is Friedman?
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?
An Austrian.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
The acid bath?
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Whats that? A word?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
What did they say?
The king said you're his finest archer...?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
And?
Yes, probably... maybe...
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Arrest them!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
But where are you going to be?
Trial?  What trial??
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
What difference does it make where she comes from?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Jeanne, look behind you.
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Stop it!  What are you doing?
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
They won't come anyway.
No.  That was a sword in a field.
So your memory's coming back?
Whose were they?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Really?
How are you doing?
He'll be back before curfew.
When's your baby due?
Halina?
Funny time to say this.
Can you help?
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Can you help us?
We're recruiting.
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You sell anything?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
Sorry, I don't remember.
I don't know how to thank you.
Ohh the tag is broken.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
No.
Everyone has to practice.
We can't leave the piano
What does she say?
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
And when is the next lesson?
You the owner here?
I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
Yeh, go ahead.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Then why ain't he dead?
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
I like griftin'.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
What about the other one?
Who's got the contract?
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
You in?
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Hooker!
What do you mean?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
And you were gonna pay me back?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
No.
Don't think I know him.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
What's your next step, Nick?
Yes.  He admitted it.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Said he stole his invention.
Do you think I care
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Don't.  It's horrible.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
This is my wedding.
Where are you going?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
I know -- I know --
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Did you kill her?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Have you got a pistol permit?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Get anything?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
You mean that body-----?
When was that?
Goodbye.
That's ridiculous.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
What did you do with the rest?
Did you get my money?
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
What'll I do if something comes up?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Well, don't you?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Hello, baby.
You got types?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Where did you get that?
But it's Christmas now.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
But Wynant --- ?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Not with all your money!
Goodbye, darling.
Nick!
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
I don't know.
I hope you're well.
Who fired you?
Wha...
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
For climbing.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
You ready?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
I've got no stomach for murder.
I out rank you, that's why.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They'll shoot us!
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Just relax.
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
It's a fire fight.
They're doing more than slapping.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
What the hell took so long.
First Wes, now you?
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want to die.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
Oh, God...
Which way do we go!?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
What is this?
Now you need me.
You ever think about dying?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
How long we going to keep this up.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
You down?
What did you get?
Now?
What time is it?
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
THX and me.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
What are you doing here?
I was lost.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
You don't know that!
They're not here.
Who the heck're you?
Hey, look--
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Which one's which?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Your partner?
What's up?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
Lane oil...
Jesus...
Then why tell me?
Stay here.
Who are you calling, sis?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
I know.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No.
But--
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
And harems ... ?
Like it?
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron?
Two weeks and three days.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Five, seven, and nine--
He recognized you!
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Oh! You didn't read it!
What's wrong now?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Then riding together.
How do you like my dress?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
I know all your tricks.
Any minute I want!
On the night table.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
I don't believe it!
But it could have been glorious.
Yes, madame!
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
I think you'd better go.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
That's true.
Your bag?
Didn't you take it with you?
The pumps --
The ship will sink.
Shit.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
But I was with him the whole time.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
No you won't.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack.
Well, here you are.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
She had beautiful hands.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
I know, I know.
You have to go for help.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
Yes sir.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Montana?
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
How about a little game later?
Nice lines--
You're not very ambitious, are you?
This is Mr.--er--
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
When?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
You mean that?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
I thought you were a smart guy.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
This is a business trip!
My change.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No--not much--excepting-- 
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I don't get the humor of that remark.
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
--And he has sex appeal.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
How much did you lose?
About twelve hundred.
I wish I could.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Not because of Ned.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Why?
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Not now.  I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
On three?  You call it.
Then what do I do?
You really look awful.
Not half as bad as I feel.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
You know, we might just pull this off.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Where do you get these questions?
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
Always?
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
'Least you admit it.
'Least they don't scare women.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Acquired?
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
It's too late -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
How did you get this number?
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I see.
So why did you leave?
Briefly.
...And what's that, my dear?
- Instant melt-down.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Your new car. 
Paris?!? What are you doing here?
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just - say it. Say it just once.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Political considerations?
Fishing?
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Who knows? Fog, night...
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I'll keep that in mind.
And what do you call this?
... Do you have a gun?
What?
He's killed closer.
What now? And don't give me some movie clich like 'trust me.'
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Who's in charge here?
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
No.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
Junior spends time with his child.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
You were in hell?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
Not anymore, not in the city.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
How is the garden doing?
But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
What's the problem here?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
How is he doing?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Wow!  Cool!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Here!  In the car!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
You can't!
Can!
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Spaceship.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Hi!
Let's string him up by his pull- string!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Oh no, Hannah!
MOM!!  MOM!!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
There.
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Woody?!
Woody!  Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
There's no mirror.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
Finn ...
So had I.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
Juliet who?
I'm Melanie.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
What?  What is it?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
So my wife is lying?
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Did you meet the President?
Is this bad for him?
Helena --
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
Yes.
How are your grades?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
Depends on the state.
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
When will you do it?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
What's he doing up here?
Somewhere safe.
You should feel good about this.
One question.  How did you find about this?
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'm sorry.
For fuck's sake.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Jesus.
Diane.
Where are you going, Diane?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Sorry.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Oh, really?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
That's nice.
Exactly.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Say something, Mark, say something --
You know.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
What?
That's tough.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
Are you serious?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Your favourite dish.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Not General Korrd.
Who is it he reminds you of?
What do you mean?
Why?
I have a half brother.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Is it possible?
Is what possible?
I must have your starship.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
He's not?
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
You call that getting over it?
Of what?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
This town's full o' live ones.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
What about our friend - Sark?
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
There's another beam!
Flynn... you can't... I
How 'bout yourself?
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
What's goin' on?
Why is everything...like this?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Where are you going?
Where are you off to young lady?
You seem fine now.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Why?
What's this for?
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Guy's a spook!
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
She could be telling the truth.
I thought this look like your work.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
He's got it.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.
They must've just missed me.
Would you say he was boring, then?
What?
Yes or no.
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Natasha?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Is it working yet?
God, you have great legs.
What are you going to do?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
What about the husbands?
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Beat it.
What's going on, Harry?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Worse than Cairo?							*
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I don't know.  I have to think...
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
How?
Who is this woman?
His wife.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
What letter?
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Tell me about yourself.
There's nothing to tell.
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
Very much. Now, where were we?
What are your turn-ons?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
Almost four years.
She OD'd, didn't she?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Is he black?
Is he nice?
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
So you do eat pussy!
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
I'm her husband.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
What?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Clarence...
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
I'd fuck Elvis.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Say it, goddamn it!
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
What makes you think I would do that?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Not a tiny little vial -
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
I understand.  There'd be no point.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
So that...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
What?
Are you hurt?
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
I'm not crazy.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
Might be tight.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
Where to?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
How much.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Hundred-fifty.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Yeah, but it was shot.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
What do you want?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
What's the matter?
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Nice place you got here.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Did you ever?
Have you ever been there before?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
To get my car.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
No.  I swear it.
Accident.
Live there?
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
How do you know if you've never tried?
About things.  About your wife.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not talking sense.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
A hundred-forty-five really.
Kids.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
I didn't do anything.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
I call the policia.
What do you want for free?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
More or less.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
What the fuck do you want?
Like you don't know.
Talk?  About what?
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
That's a bit much.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Come on, Jake --
What happened to your hand?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You own this place?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
How much time?
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You've been there?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Do you have to call me that?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
Thank you, Bobby.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
What's the matter?...Grace?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Grace ... Grace?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
I busted my leg!
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
What kind?
Genuine Draft?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Son of a bitch!
Anybody hurt?
They look nice.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
Yes.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Skeptical about what?
Just give me a minute.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?
Quick.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
I won't make any noise.
I'll help you.
No.
No.
No Jeremy.
How much did you take off?
How many did you put on that time?
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Against a window.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
...I got a present for you.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
We was... lyin'.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
He give 'em names?
Scouting?
Three days. Are you hungry?
Free ones?
Your wife?
He admit it?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Property.
What's all that wood?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
I could of... easy.
He said that, huh?
You missed him? You didn't...?
Say, Bill...
That was... the first one.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You sure you ain't armed?
Three ways?
He musta been movin' right along.
Sally?
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
HEY, KID.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Worms was comin' out.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
There was ninety-one million -
Who ?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
They ruined me tonight.
Come home, Dean.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
Get out.
What fence? Who?
I was out of line.
What is it Keaton?
What if I
Who's your boss?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
You're lying.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
He didn't have my lawyer.
You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
No...
Keaton was Keyser Soze
This is all bullshit.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Yes.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
How did you settle on the amount?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Anything special about the case?
Yes.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Yes!
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
I did.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
No.
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Hold on a second.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
'Code Blue'...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Yes.
I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.
I understand.
... that's perfectly all right.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
That happens.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Do you think it's my fault?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Who told you that?
Is there going to be a later...?
You, you don't under...
Joe...  Joe...
Dr. Gruber.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Are you with me...are you awake...?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Hi.
Thank you.
Mrs...
Yes.
Kathy Price...
Yes...
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Yes.
Me, too.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
Interesting business.
How long have you been back?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Just let me talk to you.
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
But you haven't lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
No? Then what?
Yes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Scottie, what are you doing?
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Scottie!
I need you.
Scottie --
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
You don't remember.
Where had you been before?
This afternoon.
Wandering about.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
How can you be sure?
How old?
Do you hear anything?
Yes...
Where were you born?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
No.
I'm here, I've got you...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Go on.
No, never!
Yes... you run this hotel.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
How do you know? Personal experience?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Three whole weeks.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Out!
Carlotta?
Mm. Better.
Did you need it?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
What?
I said how's it going?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
First of all...
Why was the floor wet?
You're pathetic.
More.
What?
I'm calling the ambulance.
We have to call the ambulance.
I'm calling the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
What?
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Don't ever stare him down.
No way.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
She's still working?
I got her arm.
You said that Boyd.
We need padded chairs.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
I'm serious.
Not a prayer.
The hell I did!
Nope.
You hate women.
You have a King fantasy.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Take Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Not really, no.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
I think so.
What else have you forgot?
What?
Who else?
He's quiet.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Of course.
What kind of seats can we have?
Do you love me?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Not yet.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
What are you doing?
What about the chairs?
What's the word on the chairs?
Can we just talk this out?
Yeah. You.
Don't even.
Do you love me?
Micheal, by accident.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
But...
What does that mean?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I'm not breathing right.
I don't hear it.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Did he try to kiss you?
There.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
...embarrassing, shameful...
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
Take your time. I wish I had.
Right.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
What's that?
Enedina and Paco ...
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Evil.
Unfortunately ...
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Fifteen yards.
He was asking for it.
If you wake first, wake me up.
You see how much you like her?
Where's the dough?
I don't know, sir.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Why not?
There's been an accident.
Why are you crying?
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.
I have a headache.
What?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
He was a computer program for crissake.
I've seen worse.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
He hears...everything.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
How should I know?
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I am beautiful, aren't I?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know I am.
Real effective security...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Which way?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
Nice work.
That's why I'm asking.
Then shoot him already.
The symphony of collision...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What can it hurt.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
It won't hold.
What crisis?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
What is it?
....we landing?
The American "people"?
...you want us to go to War...
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Anything at the Airport?
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
How's your wife?
Oh, MiGod.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
We're due at Andrews. 
Whaddaya think?
Who're you working for?
I have a question for you.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Would you go to War to do that? 
...why?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Is there a press conference today?
Trade Re1ations.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
How much...?
Do I know you?
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
Remember the Maine...
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
Three-o-three...
I think it's fine?
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
Watch me.
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
See y'at the Finish Line.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
Yes. 
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
a "pond," or
Please, no thanks... 
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
What the hell...
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
...Work okay?
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...thanks Natalie.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
What if he asks where I got the money?
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
What does that mean?
What makes you think you can?
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello Bud.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Then why do you still like her?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Well divide 18 into three
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Sell my soul?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
So much.
Your husband?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Fine.
You were in an accident?
Who are you?
That's not...It's not like that.
I've never even met you.
I wanted to apologize.
Would you like some iced tea?
Um...sure.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
She never mentioned her father.
...just so she could cut them off.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
You are?
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Someone's there.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Did he say that?
I don't know...
Whatcha reading?
I am, really.
In the house.  I was scared.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
You are so brilliant.
That's...
"...for my father."
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
See?
What am I looking at?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
What?
...Please stop...
She did it.
What?
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Nothing was ever more false.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Who is this...?
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Do what you can.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
FAST.
To love, you must be able to feel.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
There is no one here but the dead.
Oh god...
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
They like you ------- kids.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
No.    This is unreal...
You did that, didn't you...?
You alright...?
I can't.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Rowan Mayfair.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
OH MY GAWD!
And it can't be forged?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
You don't know?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
First finish your tea...
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
Someday, I'll find out.
Check this out.  Hurry!
What is it now?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
You got everything you ever wanted.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Yeah?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Hmmm?
Ted! Do something!
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
It's not up to me.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I have absolutely no intention--
Don't write that part.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Your dad taught you everything.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
Eventually you'll let go.
And then what?
But you never do.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
I'm very aural.
Tell me more.
Come on.
Maybe someday.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Like what?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
You called the cops on us?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
What kind of ideas?
I can't wait to see the pictures.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Kelly.
And where might that be?
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
No.
How long?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
About a year ago.
Ms. Toller?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
No you don't.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Don't forget the car wash.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
About what?
Get away from me.
Sam, for godsake.
The one you bought at school.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Jesus, man... You okay?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
How...
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Starting with a screw?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
You feeling all right?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Oh, damn!  That's it.
I know!  I know!
Yes, me!
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Would that include me?
You bring the best out in a man.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Nicely said, sir.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Now it's a bomb.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
Not today, Willow.
I can't.
I do what I'm told.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
What's that?  I hear something!
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
I will.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Who?
Who are you!  Who are you!
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
How??
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
I'm not going in there.
Who??
I've seen pictures.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
John, why?...
Your hole is healed, then?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
...I want to say a thing.
You know who?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
But why would they murder...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Your husband's?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
But Stoltzfus said...
We had some lemonade and he left.
But... You may not be well enough.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
Anybody know about this?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
You hear me?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You know where he is.
John said you're Amish.
What's so funny?
Who was that man?
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No --
Dorothy!
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Our echo.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Aw, come, come, come --
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
...room --
...paper?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oil can.....Oil can....
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
A home --
But why?  Why?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
I have so got brains.
...free!
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Oil can what?
Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
...along.
Oh -- Oh --
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Yes, you.
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why! 
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Mr. Gale!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
...to Dorothy!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?
Well --
Stop that dog!
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
I was the one who brought that money in...
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
This is the end.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
What about our end?
Washington?
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
I'm here, Laurie.
Collect me?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
What if youre wrong??
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
We should get back --  What?
Their real names, please.
What does this mean?  What does it --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Maybe I'll do that.
Ever see one of these before?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Up yours.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
I was invited. What's your story?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
They tell me you're an American agent.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
When can I see you again?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't you afraid?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
What are you doing?
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Dude, what are you doing here?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
What's this?
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
What does that mean?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Are you all right?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He takes his work seriously.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
The intention of registration act -
What are you going to do?
How?
I'll find him.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
It does indeed, Max.
No!
Give him an extra dollar.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Yes.
Will you miss me?
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
Good night.
Well... we'll see.
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Vermicelli.
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
I thought you wanted to.
What wockers?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
What?
I want that brain.
Hmm!
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Throw the second switch!
What?
More, do you hear me?
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Don't fall for that one.
All right -- where is she?
Come on, big fellow!
Is everything ready?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
I thought it was wonderful.
It looks that way.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Give him the sedative!
I see what you mean.
What?
Nor to Elizabeth.
How long is it so far?
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Food!
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
